    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>Thank you all for coming here very much, this evening. Actually the seminar, I originally thought of giving this time was on Srimad Bhagavatam and the other day in New Vrindavan. When we were in New Vrindavan, I was discussing with mother Krsna Priya about the seminar, then I realized to cover or to do justice to Srimad bhagavatam in four days, two hours sessions will not be possible. Therefore I was thinking, I have to give a seminar on some topic rather instead of presenting the entire Srimad Bhagavatam, I thought of selecting some specific topic from Srimad Bhagavatam and give the seminar on that. Then it occurred to me that recently, in South Africa, I saw there was a big advertisement, many billboards and many posters announcing the seminar that to be given by someone from India, a spiritualist from India and the title of that seminar was “The Art of Living”. When I saw that posters, I was thinking a Sadhu’s business was not to give seminars on Art of Living, because whenever one takes to spiritual life, one thing one realizes is that the real goal of life is not here, it is beyond this material nature and then it occurred to me why don’t I give a seminar on Art of Dying and then it occurred to me that actually Srimad Bhagavatam is extensively deep dealing with this topic the Art of Dying and that Art of Dying is actually leading to the way to immortality. If one knows how to die, then he attains immortality, he attains immortal life. So that is the ultimate objective of spiritual persuasion, spiritual pursuit. It occurred to me at that time, that actually this would be an appropriate topic, to give a seminar on, the Art of Dying, the way to immortality. And Srimad Bhagavatam is actually teaching us that art. Although Srimad Bhagavatam originated when Vyasadeva was summarizing the teachings of the Vedas and trying to present it in such a way that the disturbed and distressed short living entities of this age of Kali could understand the purpose of Srimad Bhagavatam or the purpose of the Vedic wisdom and he systematically analyzed the Vedic wisdom. First he divided the Vedas into four then he wrote different aspects of Vedic wisdom like dharma Shasta, Itihasa, Puranas and Upanishads. These are different branches of Darshans and these are all different branches of Vedic wisdom and finally he presented the summary of the essential understanding of the entire Vedic wisdom in the form of Vedanta sutra, the aphorism of Vedanta and still when he was not feeling totally content, then Narada Muni appeared to him and instructed to him to present Srimad Bhagavatam which is the unalloyed glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And in this way, Srimad Bhagavatam was presented by Srila Vyasadeva as the summary and the essence of the entire Vedic wisdom. ‘Nigamaha kalpa tarur’ the ripe fruit of the desire tree of the Vedic wisdom. So that is what Srimad Bhagavatam was, as it was presented by Srila Vyasadeva. But then this Srimad Bhagavatam became further, God’s nectarean aspect due to the presentation of Sukadeva Goswami. So the real presentation of Srimad Bhagavatam was actually made by Srila Sukadeva Goswami. But what was the occasion? It’s very interesting. What was the occasion of the presentation? The King of this planet Maharaja Pariksit, he was cursed by Kali, the personality who is predominating this age, whose business is to establish irreligiosity, whose business is to introduce sinful activities and promote sinful life. That personality, Kali, considered Pariksit Maharaja, to be the arch enemy; his arch enemy and he realized that in order to establish his purpose, in order to establish himself, or his objective, he has to get rid of this King Pariksit Maharaja. And he did not have the means or the ability to get rid of Pariksit Maharaja, but Pariksit Maharaja was too powerful for him. Therefore he arranged that a Brahman boy for cursing and this boy were so powerful although he was just a boy of seven or eight yrs old but he cursed Pariksit Maharaja. That’s a long story and I am skipping the details and I am sure all of you know what the occasion was and so this Brahman cursed Pariksit Maharaja that he would die within seven days and when Pariksit Maharaja got the news that he has been cursed, that he is going to die in seven days or he has only seven days left. So Pariksit Maharaja did not try to counteract the curse, he just left everything, left his kingdom, left his palace, left his family, left everything, and he went to the bank of Ganges in order to prepare himself for this occasion of dying. He has seven days to die so okay, let me take advantage of the seventh day and prepared myself to die. And he just sat down, although he was a king and not just a king, he was a king of the entire earth planet including the ocean. That is how it has been described sa sagara, sagara means ocean, sa means along with or including. So he was a ruler of the earth planet including the ocean, the entire planet. But he became completely detached because he knew to begin with, he knew that some day he has to leave this world. A person who is situated in knowledge, he knows that one day he will have to die. One who is born is bound to die. The word druva means fixed, unwavering, or you can say absolute, truth. This truth is unavoidable isn’t it? In the material nature, although this material nature is a relative reality, here everything is relative. But there is only one absolute truth in this material nature. What is that absolute truth? That everybody has to die. So even in this relative reality, there is one absolute truth that is death. So one who is situated in knowledge knows that he has to die. But those who are ignorant, they try to avoid death. Well, it’s natural, one does actually in reality, and one does not want to die. But in order to understand how to attain immortality, one must first know what death is. What is death? Then only we can understand how to conquer it. If you don’t know who your enemy is, is there any question of defeating him. Can you defeat or conquer an enemy whom you do not know? Therefore in order to conquer your enemy, what do you have to do? First of all you have to recognize who he is, what he is, what his strength is, and how he can harm me and then you take the action to counter that influence. So those who are situated in knowledge, they know that death is inevitable some day or other. Therefore one who is situated in knowledge he does not get bewildered with this issue of death. Rather he prepares for that. Just like Pariksit maharaja did, and this is an indication that he was situated in knowledge. Pariksit maharaja was a king; he could have made so many arrangements to counteract that. Actually if he wanted, he could have. You know how, just to give one example: Pariksit maharaja was cursed that he would be killed by being bitten by a serpent, celestial serpent called Takshaka. So there was one, you can say, a snake doctor, the expert of counteracting poison, his name was Kasyapa, a sage, a saintly person, a Brahman. So he heard that the king was going to be bitten by a snake. So he said fine, I will come to counteract. So he was going to Pariksit Maharaja, at that time Takshaka was also coming, so Takshaka came in the disguise of a Brahman, although he is a serpent, although he is a snake. But he has, the celestial serpent, the celestial being having the ability to transform themselves in different forms. Takshaka took the shape of a Brahman and he was coming and on the way they met. Takshaka and Kasyapa said, ok let’s travel together, so then they started to talk Takshaka: “Where are you going?” Kasyapa: “I am going to Hastinapura.” Takshaka: “Why are you going there?” Kasyapa: “I heard that the king is going to be bitten by a snake and he is going to die, so I am going there to save the king.” Takshaka became very angry. He immediately assumed his form as a serpent, a snake, a huge gigantic snake and he said “I am Takshaka; I am going to bite him. Do you think you can counteract my poison?” Takshaka immediately, he just bit, a banyan tree, a huge banyan tree. And the tree immediately turned into ashes and he said: “See this is the power of my poison, and do you think you are going to counteract that? Immediately the king’s body is going to burn into ashes as soon as I bite.” So Kasyapa did not say anything. He took some water from his water pot, did his achaman, and cleansed his mouth before chanting the mantra and then he took some more water on his palm. He chanted some mantras, sprinkled some water, on the heap of ash and immediately it came to live. The tree was regenerated. So Takshaka was surprised. And then he took another course to convince him, he said: “Look, you may counteract my poison, but you won’t be able to counteract the curse of a Brahman. So you go back home. And I will give you all these most precious gems. So you go back home.” So Kasyapa considered that is true like the curse of a Brahman is irretraceable. So he went back. And now we can see that there are more personalities who could have counteracted the curse. But Pariksit Maharaja did not take that course. He considered that “Whenever the Lord will desire me to leave this planet, I will leave. So, now if that is His desire then in seven days time, I am going to die, ok, at least, I am fortunate that I have got the information that I am going to die in seven days time. I have seven days to prepare myself.” He considered that to be a very very great fortune that he had seven days to prepare. We can consider that most of the time, we don’t actually want to prepare and sometimes death comes without our knowing about it. All of a sudden we die. So in that respect, Pariksit maharaja was fortunate and he considered himself very fortunate that at least he has seven days to prepare himself. So he did that. He, as I mentioned earlier, he left his kingdom, he went to the bank of Ganges, he sat down without taking any food, water, without sleeping. He just was preparing himself for his final moment. And at that time, all the greatly saintly persons from the universe gathered there. They all came there in order to help the king at a difficult time like that. So many saintly personalities gathered, assembled there and many of them gave different advice to Pariksit maharaja, but Pariksit Maharaja was not interested in their advice. They, with all good intention tried to give him good advice but Pariksit Maharaja considered that these advices were pertaining to the material facilities, material benefits. What kind of benefit? The benefit of elevating to higher planetary system. The earth planet is not the only planetary system in this universe. There are many higher planetary systems. Now, there are possibilities of elevating to higher planetary systems where the facilities are better. But Pariksit maharaja was not interested in these kind of advices because he considered the ultimate goal of life is not to enjoy this material nature, whether in higher planetary systems or lower planetary systems, because this 

material nature is temporary, no situation in this material nature is going to be permanent and this material nature ultimately is a place of misery. So what’s the question of enjoyment in a place of misery! Jaya Sri Sri Radha Golokananda ki Jai! Sri Sri Gaura Nitai ki Jai!! Sri Prahlad Nrsimhadeva ki Jai!! Srila Prabhupada ki Jai!! So he was not interested but, at that time Sukadeva Goswami appeared there. A very wonderful personality. He was a sixteen year old boy, very handsome, very, very handsome, a personality who was endowed with all the symptoms. He was so absorbed in spiritual consciousness. He was so absorbed in thinking about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and his pastimes that he did not have any external consciousness. He did not have any body consciousness so much so that he did not care to wear anything, he was naked. And he just arrived there and when he arrived there, everybody, all the exalted saintly personalities could immediately recognize that this is a very special person and they stood up out of respect. Although he was a 16 year old boy. And then they considered that this is the most exalted personality meaning, this personality has the highest spiritual knowledge and Pariksit Maharaja also recognized him and he offered him the exalted seat of a teacher and he questioned him. Pariksit Maharaja asked him many relevant questions dealing mainly with this particular topic. His main question was: I’m going to die within seven days, tell me how to prepare myself for that occasion. I have only seven days left and how must I utilize these seven days and then Sukadeva Goswami started to instruct him. And that is what Srimad Bhagavatam is. Therefore while we are covering this topic, we are actually covering Srimad Bhagavatam. The essential teachings of Srimad Bhagavatam. Generally, when I give a seminar, I like to write on the board and walk about and I thought of doing that and I got this board here but I am little concerned that many of you are taping and if I stand up then you won’t be able to tape. Therefore I thought of one simple solution to this problem. Babai how is your hand writing on the white board? I am making some points, the points that I make, you can just write them. I will just make these few points, those who are taking notes, so the few points that I was making, I already made, I will just give you those points. Like one point is Pariksit Maharaja’s approach to death. How did Pariksit Maharaja approach his imminent death? Did he try to call some doctors and try to save himself? No, rather he faced, he prepared himself to face it. And, then when he decided to face it, he was confronted with two possibilities. One is the apparent goal and the other is ultimate goal. So what is the apparent goal? The apparent goal is elevation to higher planetary systems and what is the ultimate goal? Ultimate goal is total freedom from material bondage, and elevation to spiritual world. The higher planetary system is also part of this material nature. Like if we consider this material nature to be a prison house, then elevation to higher planetary systems are something like from lower grade of prison existence to a higher grade of prison. Like, I don’t know if you have it here, but in some countries in India, they have things like you know third class prison. The worst I think is vigorous prisoner. They have to work very hard. I mean, then, in this way it comes to second class prisoner, and then comes a first class prisoner. Now, if a prisoner, thinks, I am in third class, let me be elevated to second class and then to first class. Is it an intelligent endeavor? To try to be elevated to a higher level of prison systems. No, what would be the intelligent thing to do? Get out of the prison, who wants to be in a prison? So, what did you write Babai? So, maybe you can make a point here. The material nature is like a prison house, for some and to some others, this material nature is like a boarding school. Ok we will discuss about this point now. Now, who are put into prison? The prison is design for whom? The criminals. Does a gentleman go to a prison? He may go for an occasional sightseeing, but he does not go to live in the prison. The prison is meant for the criminals. What is the definition of criminals? What is crime? Breaking of law, to break the law. The state or the king has given 

some laws. And those laws are meant to be followed or abided by. Now, those laws have to be followed. Why? Because, the law is actually meant for peaceful and prosperous living of the citizens of the state or the kingdom. When somebody breaks the law, it creates some disturbances. People who have perverted mentality of not abiding by the law of the king, has a perverted mentality. When somebody has a perverted mentality, then that mentality has to be rectified therefore the prisons are designed. Prisons are the place to rectify the perverted mentality of the law breakers, criminals. In the prisons, the individuals get punished. They not always get punished. They also get rewarded. In this way, they know what is right and what is wrong. And when they do the right thing, in the prison also they appreciate the rewards. And when they do something wrong, then they get a stick. So the purpose is to rectify, to correct and to reform them. Now those, who are the law breakers, and whose law is it here? There is the ultimate law that has been given by the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And the law given by the Lord is actually called religion. Whenever we consider religion, whichever religion it is, whether it is Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hindus, whichever religion we approach, we see in all the religion, we are speaking about God and the laws that He has given and how should one abide by those laws isn’t it? Doesn’t all religion speak about God? Doesn’t all religion give the injunction of what the Lord’s instructions are? Or motivate one or direct one or instructs one to follow those instructions of the Lord? When somebody abides by the laws of the Lord, then actually they become rewarded but when they break them, they become punished. That is the ultimate consideration of imprisonment. For the criminals, this material nature is like a prison. But the material nature also, has another aspect or another side of it. And that side of it is something like a boarding school. In the boarding school, parents sent their children to the boarding school. They are away from home. But what they learn in the school, they learn how to become qualified to live in the free world, a life of prosperity. Those who abide by the law of the Lord, for them, this material nature are like a boarding school. Those who are there in the boarding school, they are away from their home. But actually, they are preparing themselves to go back to home and lead a life of prosperity, become successful individuals there. Now, it’s up to us, to turn this place into a prison house or a boarding school. The advantage of a boarding school is when you finish your term, when you finish your education, then you go back home. It is just taken for granted. And that we will go home. You are not here to stay forever. So, the Lord, also, is present in the hearts of every living entity and he is actually considering or determining how an individual is living his life or what is going on inside. Inside, means what is going on in his consciousness. Externally, we may bluff, cheat or fool others, but internally we can’t. Now the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart, as the Super soul and He is witnessing everything. Now, there as the super soul also , the Lord has two ways to deal with the individual, like to the criminals, He is acting as a witness and He is seeing how they are acting accordingly and punishing them or rewarding them. And those who have accepted this place as the boarding school, the Lord sitting in their heart are acting as the teacher. He guides them from within. Now those who lead a materialistic life, those who think that the ultimate goal of life is to enjoy in this material nature and do not really want to accept the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or another reality beyond this material nature which is the spiritual reality and those who do not have any information about the spiritual reality and they do not know, that they actually came from the spiritual reality, therefore the spiritual reality is actually their home. They simply keep on wandering in the material nature from one cell to Another and the Lord in their heart acts as the witness. The Lord is seeing every action of every individual. Those who are fortunate enough to understand that beyond this 

material nature are another reality, the spiritual reality. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the center of that reality. He is the Supreme Creator, the Supreme Proprietor, the Supreme Maintainer, and that Supreme Personality of Godhead is our dear most friend or He is our dear most Father. When you recognize the individuals, those who recognize that, to them this material nature becomes like a boarding school. And they take advantage of the situation in the school by learning, they learn and who is the teacher? The Lord and his associates and his devotees. They are helped by those exalted devotees of the Lord and ultimately they are helped by the Lord Himself. And they simply prepare themselves to get out of the school and go out to their home and become a successful individual. Now that is something like the end or that is the time of final examination. And the life is the span of time, the span when we get the opportunity to prepare ourselves for the exams. We study throughout the year for what? We prepare ourselves for the year in school for what? They sit for the exams, and when we prepare ourselves well, then we pass with the flying colours straight A’s and when we fail to prepare ourselves then we flunk. So now a person who has prepared well, will he be afraid to sit in the exams, rather he looks forward to the exams. A good student, I am sure all of you are, or had been, did you look forward to exams? Well certain degree of nervousness may be there, before the exam, but when you get the question papers, when you get the papers and you see you know the answer to all the questions, then how do you feel? Don’t you feel excited and in bliss, in ecstasy? Therefore those who prepare themselves, they get into ecstasy when the exams come. Although some initials nervousness may be there, and now consider what actually happens, when a person who has prepared himself well, preparation means what does that preparation means for this exams? This preparation is actually preparing to establish our relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The real preparation is to recognize the Lord, to recognize the Supreme Personality of Godhead and establish our relationship with Him. Throughout our life, we are actually preparing for that, how shall I face the exams? Throughout our life if that becomes our only concern and then the time comes for the final exams and what is that exam? That is the time when we are going to leave this body. So at that time what do we do? We are waiting for this moment to come and we are out of this body. Will it happen or will it always remain in this body ? Well, there is another consideration; a third possibility is losing your consciousness. Lose your consciousness means something like you fall asleep, no more consciousness, no more awareness. Now to a devotee, that is the most undesirable situation. A devotee doesn’t want to lose his consciousness, rather at that time, he wants to fix his consciousness onto the lotus feet of Krsna. That spiritual endeavor has been described as Krsna consciousness. So throughout our life we are trying to be Krsna conscious. And then the final moment comes and then we see Krsna, how will you feel? How will you feel that your entire endeavor, throughout your life has been successful? Now you are face to face with Him. Or you are in a situation, when you have been taken to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyway these aspects we will discuss tomorrow, today we are just, today we won’t get into the examples of individuals leaving the bodies and how they left their body. Like today, we are just covering the basic understanding of this aspect of what life is, what death is. Now let us again for clarity, let us go back to that point what is life? What is the definition of life? You are alive what makes you think you are alive? Consciousness. What is consciousness? Consciousness is the awareness of being. I am, therefore I am alive. When I fall asleep and I do not have any awareness, whether I am alive or dead, then, what happens? do I exist? No. When you are fast asleep. Sleep also has two aspects. One is dreams and the other is dreamless. Like in dream, dream is actually a situation in a subtle existence. When the subtle body is active, that is called dream. When both the subtle and gross bodies are active, then it is 

called wakeful state. When you are awake, then both the gross bodies and the subtle bodies, anyway for clarity I was saying gross body, we have two types of material bodies. Cintamani can you tell us what are those two types of material bodies, gross and subtle? What does the gross body comprise of? Earth, water, fire, air and ether. And subtle bodies are comprised of? Radhika do you know subtle body? Ok I will ask your mother. What is the subtle body? Subtle body is made up of mind, intelligence and false ego. The mind is also matter, subtle matter. These are the three subtle elements. Earth means a solid substance; water means liquid, fire means fiery, air and ether. These five are gross material elements. With these five gross material elements, we have this gross body. Beyond this gross body we have a subtle body made of mind intelligence and false ego. When you are awake, then both the gross and subtle body is active. Like, our body is also active or aware and we are also aware of our subtle body. When you fall asleep, then the gross body becomes inactive. We become unconscious of the gross body, but the subtle body remains active and the subtle activities of the subtle body appear to us like a dream. When the subtle body also becomes inactive that is the state of deep sleep. At that time we don’t have any consciousness of this material nature. Let us consider the situation between death and sleep or the other way round. Sleep we know what sleep is like. Sleep and death. What is the relationship between sleep and death? When we are asleep, although we are not conscious of our existence, our consciousness is completely inactive that state is sleep. Even at that state the soul is in the body. And in sleep we wake up in the same body. Death also is like sleep. But it is a prolonged sleep. And in death we don’t wake up in this body. We wake up in another body. And that is called the transmigration of the soul. The soul transmigrates from one body to another. The body is constantly changing. In this body also, the soul is going from One body to another for example continuous changes are taking place and since the changes are taking place in the body continuously, we don’t register it. But we do, when we somebody after a long time. Like you see a little child, and then you come after seven years, what will you see? That he has completely changed. Does he have this child body anymore? No he has got another body, his body has changed completely. Then you see him after another ten years. Now he is a man, it is impossible to recognize him, he has got a beard, moustache, he has got long hair, and he has got a big body. So in this body also the soul transmigrates from one body to another. The body changes from boyhood to youth, to old age. So Kardama Muni you agree with me? Do you remember yourself when you were a 5 year old? So when you were 5 years old, what kind of body did you have? Do you have a picture? So where is that 5 year old body today? It is not there? Today you have a completely different body. Are you the same person? You are the same person, although your body changed but you are the same person. In spite of the change of the body, the soul is the same. But will it be a logical conclusion that in spite of the change of the body, the soul doesn’t change? The existence of the soul has nothing to do with the body. Now let us consider, when the soul leaves the body, then what happens? That is what is called death. Death is actually the soul’s departure from the body. When the soul leaves the body, the body becomes dead. When the soul leaves the body, then what happens to the body? To begin with this is the dead body. This body is made of what? Earth, water, fire, air and ether. Is earth just regular earth? Is it dead matter? Or earth is alive. Earth is dead matter. Earth, water, fire, air and ether, all these are actually inert matter. Now this body is made of inert matter or dead matter? Will it be illogical to conclude that this is a dead body? Actually it is a dead body, but why this body is alive because of the presence of the soul. So it is due to the presence of the soul that the body is alive. So now who are we? So let’s make a very simple consideration who are we? Are we this body or are we the soul? We saw the body changes, but I remain the same so who is that I? When I say I, who 

do we actually indicate? Due to our conditioning of this body, we identify ourselves with the body. But actually we are the spirit soul. When the spirit soul leaves the body, and I am the spirit soul, would I continue to exist? Do I continue to exist or do I die with the body? When the body dies, do I die? No, rather when I am in this body, the body became alive. The body remains alive. So birth, life and death, they actually indicate, the birth is the soul’s acceptance of a new body. When the soul accepts a new body, we call it birth, and when the soul leaves the whole body, what do you call it? Death. And the period of the soul existence, from the time of birth to death is called life. So do you understand now what life is? Sitarani describe what is life? So now let us consider, we are in boarding school and when the exams will be? And preparation time is? Lifetime is the time to preparing ourselves for the final exams. And when we fare well in the exams, then what happens? We find that Krsna is standing there. He said ok, you did very well. All your life you have been trying to understand Me, recognize Me and establish your relationship with Me, so I am very happy with you, so come on, let’s go home. My boy did very well. I am very happy that I sent you to boarding school. So that is our ultimate objective of existence in this material nature. Now this has been very wonderfully described through an allegorical story that was the story of Puranjana in Srimad Bhagavatam. How many of you remember the story of Puranjana? Ok how many of you don’t? I explain briefly. There was a great personality, a great king called King Pracinabarhi. So King Pracinabarhi had ten sons. When his children grew up, King Pracinabarhi advised them to get married and take up the royal responsibility. So, the children felt that in order to enter the household life, in order to take the responsibility we have to prepare ourselves properly. So they went to the forest to perform austerity. Then they came across a beautiful lake. The lake was filled with, decorated with many beautiful flowers like blue, red and white lotus and there were beautiful and colourful singing birds that were there, flying around. And then to their great amazement they saw Lord Shiva coming out of the water. And then Lord Shiva gave them the instruction how to meditate, how to glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead and meditate upon Him. So in this way being blessed by Lord Shiva, they got absorbed in meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And at that time Narada Muni, considered that these ten boys are becoming so serious about their life and look at the father, he is completely absorbed in sense gratification, performing all kinds of materialistic activities, to acquire piety so that he can enjoy. So, Narada Muni thought that I must give example, good advice, but he also considered that this king, he is so gross. When people become absorbed in sense gratification their intelligence becomes quite blind. A person with blunt intelligence, in English there is an expression called dunderhead. So dunderhead cannot understand the necessities of life. So Narada Muni instead of giving him a straightforward advice, he told him a story. And the story is the story of Puranjana. Actually when Narada Muni was describing the situation of a living entity in this material nature. Puranjana means one who dwells in a body. So this body is like a city, Pura means city or dwelling place. Puri means a house. So the soul lives in the house, this body. Not only this body. This is one type of body, the human form is one type of body there are four hundred thousand different types of human bodies and there are eight millions other types of bodies, aquatics, plants, worms, insects, reptiles, birds, animals and then finally human beings. In the process of spiritual evolution, not organic evolution, the process of spiritual evolution, the human form, is the highest form of existence in this material nature. So Puranjana means a spirit soul, he told the story as I described first, there was a prince, he was wandering around in different places, then finally he came to a land between the tract of the Himalayan mountain and the salty water ocean. That’s the land of India. While wandering there he came across a city, a beautiful city with nine 

gates. Then he saw, there was a beautiful woman, an extremely beautiful woman and she was attended by ten very powerful and efficient attendants and there was a five headed serpent that was protecting this lady, this queen. She was the queen of the city. And then Puranjana came so attracted by her beauty that Puranjana approached her and wanted to marry her. Eventually they got married, they started to live in the city of nine gates and Puranjana was quite happily living. Sometimes he used to feel very depressed, sometimes he used to fight with his queen. Sometimes he had different types of adversaries. Once a very big onslaught came upon the city. The Javana king attacked the city. And a very very big fight ensured and they were fighting to protect the city and the serpent who was actually used to protecting the city was becoming gradually weaker and weaker, couldn’t really withstand all onslaught. And then the Javana king’s sister Talakanya came and embraced Puranjana. And when she embraced Puranjana, he lost completely all his power. He lost all his ability to fight. And then all the soldiers of Javana king dragged him out of the city. And the Puranjana took birth as a woman in his next life. So here Puranjana died. So next life Puranjana is born as a woman. So when her Husband died. Her husband at some point left home. She was a princess; she was married to a king. But the king left her kingdom and went to vanaprastha, went to the forest. So when the king died, this Puranjani, Puranjana is now a woman. She lit the funeral pyre. Placed her husband there and lit the fire and then she was also considering to enter into the fire and give up her life. So at that time one Brahman came and told her that he was her friend from the long past and at this time of difficulty, he came to help her. So in this way the Brahman actually rescued Puranjani and led her to the ultimate goal of life. So the king could understand that it was an allegorical story. So he asked Narada Muni why did you tell a story like that? What is the hidden meaning behind this story? So then Narada Muni explained that this Puranjani is actually a spirit soul and the spirit soul wanders in different types of bodies. Sometimes he is elevated to the higher planetary systems. Sometimes he goes to lower planetary systems. In this way, he is wandering around this universe and then he comes into the land of India or we can say the land of wisdom. A land where knowledge is available. And there he comes across this city of nine gates. And the city of nine gates is the human body. So the human body has nine gates means there are nine holes through this gate one actually goes out to enjoy the senses, derive enjoyment from the objects of the senses like two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, mouth, anus, and genitals. So these are nine gates in the human body. And the queen is the intelligence who actually makes all the arrangements for the soul to dwell in this human body and try to enjoy. The queen has ten attendants and they are the ten senses, five knowledge acquiring senses, and five working senses. The serpent that protects this city is the five types of air prana, apana, saman, vyan and udan. These five types of air is actually sustaining this body and making this body function. All the actions and functions of the body are controlled by these five types of air. And then, there is an attack from the Javana king. Javana king is the king of death. So a king of death comes along with his soldiers and his sister. then in his next life he became a woman. Then at the time of funeral of her husband, he came across this Brahman. Who is this Brahman? The Brahman is the Supersoul, the spiritual master. The spiritual master guides one towards the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead which is the ultimate goal of life and which indicates our ultimate freedom. So in this way very beautifully through many many anecdotes and incidences recorded, Srimad Bhagavatam is teaching us what is life and what is death and how to conquer it. So the Art of dying actually means how to conquer death. When we conquer death, what do We achieve, we achieve immortality. So I will stop here today if anyone has any questions please feel free to ask. Question1 HH Bhakti Charu Swami answers: You see, before death when you are alive, the question of mortality does not come. You are 

already immortal at that time. But immortality considers actually one, we are already immortal. In reality we are immortal. But the problem starts when we forgot our spiritual identity and began to identify ourselves with the body, and then when the body dies, we think that we are dying or we are dead. But when we are situated in our spiritual identity then there is no death, then actually by nature we all are immortal. The first instructions of the vedas are: “O son of immortality listen to the wisdom of the spiritual reality.” To begin with, we are the children of immortality. If our father is immortal, then we are also immortal. And only thing is that unfortunately we are trying to identify ourselves with the body and that’s the problem. Now we have to realize that we are not this body. The body is just an external covering. We are actually spiritual being. We become situated in our spiritual identity, and then there is no death. There is no consideration of death; there is no question of death. Question Two HH Bhakti Charu Swami answers: How do we become situated in our spiritual identity? When we become connected to the Supreme spirit, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then we automatically becomes situated in our spiritual identity. So to make this point clear, very nice question you brought up and I will answer it a little elaborately. A living entity, we, the spirit soul, we are very minute spiritual entities like a spark. Spark is a part of fire, a tiny little fire, but when the spark flies out of the fire and falls into a heap of ash, what happens to its fiery qualities? It loses its fiery qualities, it becomes ash. That aspect of fire that spark that it was, it loses its fiery qualities, it stops to be a spark and becomes ash coming in contact with the heap of ash. When that aspect is taken back into the fire then what happens, it automatically regains its fiery qualities. Similarly we are all spiritual beings, but we are tiny, spiritual sparks. So when we get out of spiritual reality, spiritual nature and coming in contact with the material nature, then we lose our spiritual quality and become materialized. Just as a spark coming in contact with the heap of ash becomes ash. So that is the condition, we are spiritual but we are considering ourselves with the material, fighting to get our spiritual identity. Now tell me how can we get our spiritual identity back? If we go back to the fire again, then again we become spiritualized again when we go back to the spiritual. Therefore the way to become re-spiritualized is to re-establish our contact with the supreme spirit, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By forgetting him we are falling into this material nature and lost our spiritual identity. Now if we re-establish our relationship with Him, then we will again regain our spiritual identity. I told you by re-establishing our relationship with Krsna; we develop our relationship with Krsna. Now the way to develop is by love. Love is the thing that brings us together, hates separates us. When we develop our loving relationship, then that love is actually a force that unites us with Krsna. Yes Sailesh. Question three HH Bhakti Charu Swami answers: I briefly touched this point before, anyway we will try to elaborate it let’s see. Consciousness is in simple words, it can be identified as awareness. That I am aware, that I am sitting in this room, surrounded by so many people. Question Four HH Bhakti Charu Swami answers: The thing is if the consciousness comes from the soul. Just as light comes, or heat comes out of fire. You see when there is fire; heat comes out or light comes out. Now just as light comes out of fire, similarly, one can say that consciousness comes from the soul, now that consciousness becomes subjective or effective by various factors of this material nature like three subtle elements and five gross elements like those subtle elements are mind, intelligence and false ego, the mistaken concept of our identity. So when that happens, then the soul consciousness is projected towards the material direction. Just let me take one step backwards and try to elaborate it little more. The soul is from the spiritual world. The soul is not generated in the material nature due to some chemical combination. Soul is from the spiritual world. Now the spiritual world is the world of the reality. God is the center. So when we look toward God, 

when we have our relationship with God, then we are in the spiritual world. But when we look away from God, then we look at his external creations, external energy, which is the material world and when we come in contact with the material nature. When we turn our face away from the spiritual reality and look towards the material nature and material nature being inferior and we being superior we develop a tendency to lord over the material nature. Now in reality our relationship with God is that he is the Supreme Master and we are his eternal servants. That is our identity actually. We are eternal servants of the Lord. But when we look at the material nature, then we forget our identity as servant but we resume the identity of the master now that is the mistaken identity and that is called the false ego, the mistaken concept of our identity. And then we begin to plan how we are going to exploit this material nature, that gives us the second covering of the subtle matter called the intelligence how we are going to exploit this world for our enjoyment and then through the mind, the consciousness constantly flows towards the material direction. So in this way, we get our subtle body or covering of mind, intelligence and false ego. Then according to the state of our subtle body, the material nature provides us with the gross body. Now through this body we virtually or practically try to exploit or enjoy this material nature. In this way the soul becomes entrapped in these two bodies, subtle and gross. As a result of that, the consciousness begins to flow towards this direction, material direction, through subtle body and the gross body, through the mind and through the senses. Our consciousness is going out to its different directions and trying to enjoy. That is the state of affairs in our material existence. We recognize the facts that it is not a desirable situation here. We want to enjoy but we can’t enjoy. Enjoyment is an illusory concept. A poor man wants to be a rich man and a rich man wants to be a king. No one is satisfied in his present existing situation. Either he dwells in the past or dreams about the future. But the real situation is that we are in a miserable condition here. If we are miserable here, then why should we stay here? Let’s find the right place where we can be joyful that’s why we have to make the spiritual endeavor, to go back to the spiritual world. To become situated in our natural joyful state of existence. Thank you. Hare Krishna. Questions Five HH Bhakti Charu Swami answers: Maya means the material energy of the Lord, the illusory energy which actually is manifested in the form of this material nature. It is illusory. It is not there. We are trying to enjoy, but is there any enjoyment? Like a mirage. In a desert, you see a mirage and it gives you the impression that there is water and you are very thirsty, dying of thirst. So you run after the mirage. So what happens? The mirage runs away from you. No matter how fast you ran after the mirage, the mirage will constantly ran away from you. Our situation in the material nature is like that and it’s been created by Maya, the illusory energy of the Lord. Question Six HH Bhakti Charu Swami answers: As long as you remain in material consciousness, you will be in Maya, But once you take shelter of Krsna then you are not in Maya. Thank you very much. So I will stop now, and I will see all of you tomorrow. Hare Krishna. All glories to Srila Prabhupada!!!

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p> So, we are discussing about the art of dying – the way to immortality. Yesterday, we discussed quite extensively about how Srimad Bhagavatam is dealing with this topic. As a matter of fact, Srimad Bhagavatam begins with this problem. Parikshit Maharaj is about to leave his body and Parikshit Maharaja is considering he has only seven days left; now what should he do? And then, Sukadeva Goswami came and instructed him about what he should do, and in this way we can see that Bhagavatam is actually teaching us this specific topic. 

    The main purpose of Srimad Bhagavatam is actually this art of dying. Now, when one masters this art of dying, then he does not die; that’s the wonderful thing about this art. You master this art, but when you master this art of dying, then you do not die; you achieve immortality. So, immortality is actually the natural consequence of one’s spiritual situation. 
    
    When one becomes properly situated in his spiritual identity, then he becomes immortal. To begin with, the living entities are immortal, but we have become subjected to this cycle of birth and death, which is considered to be like a whirlpool. When one falls in a whirlpool, it is very difficult to come out of it – very difficult, I mean practically impossible. He is helplessly drawn into it and this is the whirlpool of “samsara”–“samsara” means the cycle of birth and death; birth and death is cycling constantly. One is born to die and then one dies to be born again. In this respect, Krishna tells in the Bhagavad Gita that “jatasya hi dhruvo mrtyur dhruvam janma mrtasya ca”- “jatasya” means one who is born; for him, “dhruvo mrtyur”, for him death is inevitable. For him death is the absolute truth – one who is born must die. 
    
    Therefore, we see that the atheistic people try to be immortal, but they can’t; they can never become immortal. No one will ever be; no one will ever become immortal in this material nature. They are trying in so many different ways. One classic example of this endeavour to attain immortality is Hiranyakashipu. Hiranyakashipu performed such severe austerities that his whole body was eaten up by termites and ants. They made an anthill around his body and his body was within this anthill; and there are many examples in the Vedic Scriptures, of such austerities. 
    
    There was another example that has been described in the Ninth Canto – Chyavana Rishi. Chyavana Rishi was performing such austerities that an anthill was created around him, and a princess who was with her father while he was hunting, came across this strange looking anthill. She saw these two holes and there were some bright lights coming out of them and out of curiosity, she poked that with a hairpin and then blood started to come out from there. So, the father was very worried when he came to know and realised that she had hurt some great saintly personality. 
    
    So, not only Hiranyakashipu performed great austerities in such a way that an anthill was created around his body. There are many examples of the performance of such austerities. Also, we come across the example of Narada Muni who, when he was travelling, came across a yogi who was performing such austerities that an anthill grew out of his body, not grew, an anthill was created around his body. And then this person asked Narada Muni, “When you go back to Vaikuntha, can you please ask the Lord when He is going to take me back?” So, when Narada Muni came back from Vaikuntha, this yogi asked him, “Did you ask Narayana when He is going to take me to Vaikuntha?” Narada Muni said, “Yes, Narayana said that you have to come back for another lifetime,” and this yogi was very upset. He said, “Another lifetime? How can that be? I performed such severe austerities.”
    
    So, in this way we can see that through this kind of austerities, or this kind of materialistic endeavour, one can never achieve immortality. Same was the case with Hiranyakashipu. Hiranyakashipu’s austerity was actually a classic example of austerity. His whole body was eaten up; only the skeleton was standing. That means his intestines, his lungs, his heart, his brains, everything was eaten up; there was nothing left and his life air was sustained within his bones, in the marrow. 
    
    Now, still then Hiranyakashipu could not attain immortality. He was performing such austerities in order to become immortal and then, as a result of his austerities, Brahma became perturbed and Brahma himself came down and asked Hiranyakashipu, “Hiranyakashipu, what do you want?” and Hiranyakashipu said, “Please give me the boon that I will become immortal.” Brahma said, “I can’t give that boon because I, myself, am not immortal, so how can I grant you this boon?” So, this is the situation; even up to Brahma, everyone is mortal in this world –“Jatasya hi Dhruvo Mrityu”, “whoever is born must die”– there is no exception to this rule. 
    
    Brahma is born, but in a very special way. Brahma came straight from the Lord’s navel; directly he came from the Lord through His navel. Still, because he was born, although directly from the Lord, in that sense Brahma is considered to be “aja”- unborn. But still, because he is in the Universe, he is in the material nature, he took birth. Although it is not an ordinary birth, but it is some kind of birth, therefore he must die. 
    
    And Brahma Samhita describes what is Brahma’s life span; from our calculation, it may appear to be very, very long – but, what is the life span of Brahma? “yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya jivanti loma-vila-ja jagad-anda-nathah” Jagad-anda” means “brahmanda”– the Universe and “jagad-anda-nathah” means the Brahmas, not just one Brahma; there are millions of Brahmas. And what is the lifespan of these Brahmas, apparently who live for such a long, long time? What is the duration of Brahma’s day – one thousand chatur yugas. One day of Brahma is one thousand chatur yugas; one chatur yuga is 4.32 million years. And thousand, multiply by one thousand, what have you got – 4.32 billion years. 
    
    So, actually, we can’t figure out the difference; at least I can’t figure out the difference between a million and a billion. It’s so big an amount, or big a number, that we can’t figure out the difference. But that is the thing, like it is after all a huge lifespan. But compared to Krishna, not even Krishna – Vishnu, Krishna’s expansion’s expansion’s expansion’s expansion. So, “yasyaika-nisvasita-kalam athavalambya”– one breath of Vishnu is the duration of Brahma’s life. One breath – he exhales and he inhales; that’s it. And then it is said that “visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso”– he is an expansion of an expansion of Krishna, Govinda. 
    
    So, this is what material nature is like; it’s a relative reality. We may think that our lifespan is so short, only a hundred years at the most, but consider if an ant is told, “You know human beings live for such a long time; this is the lifespan of a human being.” What will the ant think? He will say, “Come on, I have had enough of that. You know, just go and tell these fairy tales to someone else, not me.”
    
    So, this is the meaning of relativity – relative. Now in relation to us, Brahma’s life is very big, but when you go to Brahma, or Brahmaloka (Satyaloka), there you will find they are lamenting, “Oh, we have got such a short span of life.”
    
    So, therefore, a person situated in knowledge will not be affected by this consideration of life and death. He is not interested in attaining immortality; rather he says, “Yes, I will die, I will die – but let me master the art of dying.” A devotee does not want to avoid death, but he learns; he practises to die the right way. And when one dies the right way, then what happens? He goes back to Godhead, he goes back to Godhead. Like Parikshit Maharaj is one such example; when he found out that his life is going to come to an end soon, he just started to prepare himself for that moment. Another such example is King Khattanga. He fought with the demons on behalf of the demigods. The demigods were pleased with him and they asked him, “So, tell me, what do you want?” He asked, “Tell me, how much time do I have, how am I going to die?” They said, “You only have forty eight minutes left.” He said, “Fine, thank you very much for the information,” and he went and prepared himself for that moment. So, this is the real intelligence, this is the example of individuals who are situated in knowledge. 
    
    Another wonderful way of dying we see are the Pandavas. Pandavas, specially Yudhisthira Maharaj, when he got to know that Krishna left the planet, he felt, “Ok then, what’s the use of staying on this planet any longer? Krishna left, so what am I going to do here?” So, although he was the king of the entire earth planet, when Krishna left, nothing really meant anything to him. Everything became totally insignificant and he decided and just made arrangements, coronated Parikshit Maharaj in the throne and he said, “Ok, I am quitting.”“Where are you going?”“I am 
    
    going out in Mahaprasthan.”“Mahaprasthan” means “a great departure”–“a great departure”. This is done in a way like one starts to walk towards the Himalayas and he keeps on walking and walking and walking without eating, without drinking, without sleeping – just to make this body totally, totally exhausted, so that the soul would leave the body. And when his other brothers said, “Ok, then we are also going to join you”, Yudhisthira Maharaj said, “Do whatever you want, you know, I am not interested. Don’t ask me for permission; if you want to do it then just do it.” Then Draupadi said, “Then, I’ll also join you all. You are all leaving, so what am I going to do here?” So, she also left and they started to walk. And one after another, their bodies fell. Draupadi was the first one to fall, then Sahadeva, then Nakula, then Arjuna, then Bhima. 
    
    And where did Bhima leave his body – high up in the Himalayan mountain, near Badrikashram. Even by car, it takes a good ten hours – ten hours means, of course it’s a windy mountain road, a very wonderful road. There is nothing on the side of the road, no railings, nothing. And sometimes, this goes five thousand, six thousand feet deep. And sometimes, some cars just go that way and anyway, it’s a long way and mind you, there was no road at that time. And they just kept on walking, they just walked and walked until their body fell. So, what are they doing while they are walking? They are simply absorbed in the thought of Krishna. So when the body fell, they left their body thinking of Krishna. 
    
    This is what happens when one masters the art of dying. And Krishna Consciousness is actually the art of dying, in reality; it teaches us how to die. And tomorrow, we will discuss how Prabhupada left his body. And how, many devotees are leaving their bodies. Anyway, today we are going to discuss about the different individuals, different personalities who mastered the art of dying, from Srimad Bhagavatam. 
    
    So, one beautiful example is Dhruva Maharaja. When we consider Dhruva Maharaja’s life, it is very interesting – a six year old boy, he wanted to sit on his father’s lap and the father was henpecked by his other wife, Suruchi, Dhruva’s stepmother. She was upset that he was letting him sit on his lap. So, she wanted that her son should become the favourite and although he was young, he should actually succeed the throne. So, she was making all the arrangements; since she was the favourite of the king, the king just listened to her words. 
    
    Dhruva was denied the right to sit on his father’s lap and his stepmother actually insulted him and said, “Look, if you want to sit on his lap, then you have to take birth through my womb.” Sometimes, some women can be vicious and she was hard – stepson, just a six year old boy, but she is so cruel towards him. Dhruva was a Kshatriya; although only six years old, he was very upset and he decided to take revenge. “Ok, you said that; I will show you.” He went back to his mother and told her that this is what happened and he was crying due to this insult, so Dhruva Maharaj’s mother, Suniti, told him, “Actually, Narayana can save you from this situation. He can fulfil your desire to become the king.” He said, “Ok, I will get a position from Narayana, even higher than that of my grandfather.” That is the situation which is even higher than the situation of Lord Brahma. 
    
    Apparently, Dhruva is so attached, but then we see how gradually he is becoming detached. He performs severe austerities; he went to the forest and he was searching for Narayana. He did not know who Narayana was and he was asking everybody, “Are you Narayana?” In the forest, who 
    
    o you come across – tigers, lions, snakes. And he was asking everybody, “Are you Narayana?”“Are you Narayana?” And then finally, Narada Muni seeing his intensity, seeing his sincerity, came over and told him how to get Narayana. He gave him the mantra and asked him to meditate on the mantra and Dhruva Maharaj was meditating on the mantra in such a way that here also we can see another kind of austerities, but this is a positive austerity – positive, because it is for the sake of Narayana. 
    
    Hiranyakashipu’s austerity was negative because it was for his own immortality. Now, this is the advantage of approaching Narayana. So, he approached Narayana; in order to find Narayana, he performed great austerities. He became so absorbed in meditating on the Lord that he stopped eating and he would just eat some dry leaves whenever he had to eat. But, that also, he stopped. He was sustaining himself just by drinking some water; that also, he stopped – stopped drinking, then he stopped breathing. 
    
    And then, Narayana came to him. But when Dhruva saw Narayana, then he realised the futility of what he was going to ask from Him and Dhruva said, “What I was actually hankering for and what I had been performing such great austerities and approached You for, appears to be just like some broken pieces of glass. I don’t want that, I simply want Your association. I simply want to be engaged in Your devotional service, I don’t want anything else.”
    
    A six year old boy had such profound realisation. But, Narayana told him, “No, since that desire was there in the heart, go through it, go through it.” and he became the king. And not only a king, he became so powerful that he defeated the Gandharvas. He was slaughtering the Gandharvas in such a way that Kuvera became worried. He came and said, “Please, stop doing that. Why are you unnecessarily killing?” and that also we can see his younger brother, who was actually his rival to the throne, when that brother was killed by the Gandharvas, he became so angry that he started to wipe out all the Gandharvas. And then Kuvera came and gave him some advice and Dhruva desisted. And then Dhruva Maharaj retired from his household life and he went to the Himalayas to spend the rest of his time in the association of devotees of the Lord in Badrikashram, which is a very holy place and many saintly personalities were residing there. 
    
    Dhruva Maharaj went there and he spent his time in the association of those devotees. And then one day, the chariot came from Vaikuntha with two Vishnudutas, Nanda and Sunanda and they came and told him, “Please come, we have come to take you to Vaikuntha.” So, Dhruva Maharaj went, took a bath, bade farewell to everybody, circumambulated the chariot three times and when he was about to climb the chariot, he saw death standing with folded hands, “Please bestow your mercy upon me.” And how did Dhruva Maharaj bestow his mercy upon him – he put his foot on death’s head to climb the chariot. Now, this is the art of dying; death comes, but how does death come, not as an object of fear, not as someone who is something very, very undesirable but, he just took him in his stride, okay, put his foot on his head to alight the chariot from Vaikuntha. Now that is what actually happens for a devotee. It’s not that a devotee does not die, or we can say it seems that a devotee also dies, but how does he die; how does a devotee die? How does a devotee approach death? Death comes to him, but how – with folded hands. Therefore, it has been described that, “jagbiredhi swayam bhayam”– the personified fear actually is death and it is said that the personified death is afraid of Krishna. So, if we want to conquer death, what is the safest way, the easiest way to do that? Take shelter of Krishna – just 
    
    take shelter of Krishna, and death will be conquered, death will be overcome. So, this is actually the real art of dying. 
    
    Now, another very wonderful example is Prahlada Maharaj; his father wanted to kill him, but what did Prahlada Maharaja do? Did he make any endeavour to struggle against his father’s onslaught? No, he just depended upon Krishna. His mood, or his attitude was, “Well Krishna, if You want me to die, that’s fine.”– as Bhaktivinode Thakur is describing, “marobi rakhobi jo iccha tohara”–“whether You want to keep me, or You want to kill me, it’s simply up to You, because I am Your eternal servant,” and the servant does not have any free will. 
    
    A servant is just sold out to his master; whatever the master wants, he will do that. In that respect, I heard one incidence that the king of Saudi Arabia went to France and they took him to a kind of a tour and showed him a guillotine; they explained how it works and he wanted to have a practical demonstration of how it works – he wanted someone to be placed there and chop his head off and they said, (whoever was taking him around, probably some big government official or minister) “how is it possible?” He said, “Well, in my country there won’t be any problem because their understanding is the slave does not have his will; the master can do anything with the slave.”
    
    Of course, it’s very brutal because the masters are not really genuine masters; they are a bunch of idiots – but, when you have a genuine master, he does not subject his servants to torture, or any kind of unpleasant situation; he rather takes care of him. He protects his servants like the Gopis are praying to Krishna in Gopi Gita, “We are Your unpaid maidservants – ashulka dasike – but see what You are doing to us. You are killing us by not appearing in front of us. Our separation from You is going to cause us to die and when we die, what will people say? They will say, “neha kin badha”– look at Krishna what He did; He killed some innocent young girls, who sold themselves up completely to Him without demanding anything in return, without any salary, without any payment.” As it is, to kill a woman is bad and to kill a woman who has completely surrendered to oneself and who does not expect any price for that servitorship, to kill that woman is thousand times worse. 
    
    So, that is how they were actually provoking Krishna – actually, that was the feelings of their heart, “We are going to die due to Your separation,” so in this way we can see that devotees do not want to become immortal; devotees do not want to become immortal – rather, they would prefer to die if necessary, “Krishna, we are dying due to Your separation,” so, that is the attitude of a devotee. 
    
    Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is saying, “mama janmani janmanishware,”– Mahaprabhu is not saying, “This life I will become Your devotee so please give me liberation,”– no, Mahaprabhu is teaching us how to pray to Krishna, or in the mood of a devotee, Mahaprabhu is praying in a perfect way. Like, that life after life we can become your servants, we can be engaged in your service life after life. “Janmani janmanishware”, not one life –“janmani” means many, many lives – plural. So that is the mood, that is the attitude for devotees. Like liberation or the prospect of not taking birth again is not at all desirable to a devotee; rather, a devotee is prepared to take birth again and again and again, in order to serve Krishna. So the art of dying actually is to become totally surrendered to Krishna; and then automatically, immortality is achieved – to 
    
    begin with, one does not die because as we explained or as we discussed yesterday, death is to the body; death is pertaining to the body. 
    
    The soul never dies, but actually through death, we change our situation. Like somebody is engaged in serving Krishna; now if Krishna wants him to become situated in another kind of service, Krishna knows what is the best way to serve. So if there is another kind of service, then Krishna makes the arrangement that he takes another birth – takes another birth – he becomes situated in another body, in another kind of environment, another situation. Just like in Bhagavad Gita, Krishna is telling Arjuna, “bahuni me vyatitani janmani tava carjuna”–“many a times I have taken birth and so did you,”“tany aham veda sarvani na tvam vettha parantapa”–“but I know about all those births; you don’t.” Now, that is the situation of a conditioned soul, spirit soul, not conditioned soul. The spirit soul’s perception is minute; so is his memory – when he changes from one body to another, he generally forgets about his past life. But a devotee simply surrenders unto Krishna; he does not worry about remembering the past. That is not a big deal for a devotee. 
    
    Like Bhaktivinode Thakur is saying, “Forget the past that sleeps, never future dream at all; live with the times that are with thee and progress thee shall call.” Forget the past because it’s gone, let it sleep. “Forget the past that sleeps, never future dream at all,”– don’t dream about your future – just live with the time, that is, what can I do for Krishna now? Not, tomorrow I will serve Krishna, or yesterday I served Krishna, and today let me take a holiday. No, that is not the attitude of a devotee; devotee considers that every single moment is a wonderful opportunity, a golden opportunity to render service unto Krishna, and that is how he actually continues with his life. “Be here now,” and only the devotees can properly situate themselves in that understanding. 
    
    People may talk about it, but they don’t know how to be here now; because the material platform – this is also an important consideration- the material platform is the platform of time, which is transient. Transient means fleeting – constantly moving. In the material nature, time exists in three phases: past, present, and future. But, when we analyse it carefully then we see that in material nature, time is actually existing in the form of past and future; present is just a fleeting concept. So that is how the time is in the spiritual world, because Krishna is absolute, time related to Krishna is absolute, and those who are related to that time, they are also absolute. Now, how is it possible – we won’t be able to figure out unless we go back to the spiritual world. It’s impossible for us to understand that. 
    
    But, that is how it is; in the spiritual world, time is eternal, so when time is eternal, everything and everyone in relation to the time is also eternal. So there is no past and future there; it’s all present because everyone is totally absorbed with Krishna. They are so absorbed with Krishna that they don’t have any time to think about the past, or dream about the future. 
    
    In a way, Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur is giving an understanding, some concept – he is saying that when one perceives Krishna, like when he sees Krishna, then all his senses become his eyes. He just sees and he doesn’t have any other senses; he doesn’t smell, he doesn’t taste, he doesn’t touch – all his senses become one sense: vision, eyes. And then the fragrance from the flowers from Krishna’s Lotus Feet somehow enters into his nostrils and then he becomes all nose. He is completely absorbed in just smelling the tulasi leaves, and the flowers at Krishna’s 
    
    Lotus Feet. Then the sound of Krishna’s flute enters through his ears and he becomes all ears; then he does not see anything, he does not smell anything; so that is how one actually becomes completely absorbed in the present and he does not have any consideration for past and future. Like in the spiritual world, everyone becomes so absorbed in Krishna that he does not have any other perception whatsoever. 
    
    Anyway, to go back to our point, Prahlada Maharaj was subjected to the onslaught of his father. His father ordered to kill him. He gave many examples; one of the examples he gave to justify his killing his son – he said, “Disease generates from the body, a disease generates from the body, but one tries to get rid of that disease so that somebody born out of that body is not important. But what he does, that’s what’s important. He said look what this boy is doing; the person who killed his uncle, he is siding with him. He is a traitor; he is a disgrace to the family”, and he ordered his big, big generals – Shambhara, Namuchi – they are big, powerful generals; and he said, “Kill this boy,” and they immediately took their swords, their tridents, took their other weapons and attacked Prahlada Maharaj, shouting “Kill him, kill him”; just that shout must have been frightening. 
    
    Prahlada Maharaj was completely unperturbed and as a result of that, nothing happened to Prahlada Maharaj. Like, what could have happened – they were just trying to cut his body with these weapons, but the weapons went through his body and nothing happened to him; and some weapons just broke – the heavy metal weapons – just by touching Prahlada Maharaj’s body, they just broke into pieces and they were completely surprised. And why they couldn’t do anything to Prahlada Maharaj; because Prahlada Maharaj mastered the art of dying – isn’t it? What is the mastery, what is the way to master the art of dying – meditate upon Krishna, just depend upon Krishna. And Krishna has given His promise that nothing will happen to His devotees, “mad bhakta na pranashyate”– My devotees will never vanquish. So this is how Krishna takes care of His devotees; but of course sometimes we see that devotees die, but when we see that a devotee is dying we have to understand that death came to him like death came to Dhruva Maharaj – with folded hands, begging to receive his mercy – and the devotee put his feet on his head and stepped into the chariot to Vaikuntha. 
    
    Now, an interesting thing to note here is, “Have you ever seen a devotee leaving his, or her body?”“No, ok.”“Mark one thing, you will see that his or her face looks so, not only serene, but blissful, as if there is a smile on his face. He is completely unaffected; he left the body as if he was seeing Krishna standing in front. Now, as opposed to a devotee’s body, watch a non- devotee’s dead body and from that you know, you can make out who they had been seeing at that time. The non-devotees had been seeing the Yamadutas and the devotees saw Vishnudutas, or Krishna Himself. Now, how can one see Krishna at a time like that? Because one quality of Krishna is that He is grateful; Krishna is grateful. 
    
    Those who have dedicated their lives to Krishna, Krishna remembers that these devotees have offered everything to Me; they have sacrificed everything to Me, for My sake. So Krishna is so grateful and we also know that a friend in need is a friend indeed. So what is the greatest need for our friend; when do we need our friend the most? At that time, when we are about to leave this body. 
    
    So won’t Krishna who is the friend of His devotees; in this respect, one important thing to remember is that Bhishmadeva is addressing Krishna at the time of leaving his body as a friend of Arjuna –“Vijayasakhi”. Why he is addressing Krishna with that name, the “friend of Arjuna”? He is actually addressing that point; Krishna is friend; Krishna, You are a friend of Your devotee, so if ever I rendered any devotional service to You, then please become my friend and show Your friendship towards me at this very, very critical time. So this is how Krishna is established as “Vijayasakhi”– the friend of His devotee and Krishna is grateful; one of the qualities of Krishna is He is grateful. Like if we had done a little bit for Krishna, then Krishna will never forget that and He will reciprocate, He will reciprocate. And that’s the advantage of becoming a devotee, and that is the art of dying, and that is the way to conquer death, and that is the way to attain immortality. 
    
    Now, another beautiful example of an individual who mastered the art of dying is Gajendra, an elephant; an elephant, he was attacked by a crocodile when he went to sport in the water. Although an elephant is very, very powerful but he was fighting on a foreign place – in water – whereas the crocodile belongs to water. So, although from the normal calculation, an elephant is much stronger than a crocodile, but in the water, the crocodile is stronger; and they fought and fought and fought for a long, long time and then the elephant realised that his strength is now waning and he realised he doesn’t have any chance to rescue himself from this situation. So what did he do; at that time, when he realised now the time has come for me to leave my body, I am going to die, he realised this is the time to remember Krishna. 
    
    And as soon as the elephant remembered Krishna, what did Krishna do? As soon as Krishna realised that His devotee is in distress and he is remembering Him, Krishna immediately came there, riding on Garuda. He released the Chakra and chopped the head of the crocodile and rescued Gajendra. So this is another example of an individual who mastered the art of dying. Even an elephant can master, even an animal can master this art; and the result is – what is the result of this mastering this art – he attains immortality. 
    
    The benefit of remembering Krishna has been very wonderfully explained through the story of Ajamila. Ajamila actually did not remember Krishna at that time; he saw Yamadutas and he was scared – he was scared to death. He realised, “Well now my time is up; now I have to leave,” and he called out to his youngest son, whose name happened to be Narayana; and as soon as he called his name, it was not a pure chanting of the holy name of the Lord – it was “namabhasa”– it was chanted in a clearing stage and as a result of that, immediately Vishnudutas came. 
    
    And Prabhupada said that Vishnudutas are actually patrolling around all over; Vishnudutas are flying around in their spaceships. And whenever they hear a devotee is remembering Krishna, immediately they come to their rescue and that is the potency of the Holy Name of the Lord – even if we chant unconsciously, unintentionally. 
    
    There is another such example; according to yavana language, a boar is called haram, a pig is called haram. So this guy had been attacked by a boar; he saw the boar coming and just called out haram and what did the Vishnudutas hear? They heard “Ha Rama” and came to his rescue. So this is how the Lord – the Supreme Personality of Godhead – made His divine arrangement to take care of those who have become His devotees. 
    
    Another wonderful example from Srimad Bhagavatam about a person who mastered the art of dying is Chitraketu, who became Vritrasura. Chitraketu was a king, a very powerful king and although he had everything, he was unhappy because he did not have a son. Angira Rishi was visiting him one day and noticed that the king was looking very morose, very unhappy; so he asked him, “What happened, you have everything, you are such a powerful king, you have subdued all your enemies and you have everything to enjoy – how come you are still unhappy?” Then Chitraketu confided in him that he didn’t have a son, he didn’t have a successor to the throne. 
    
    Although he married so many beautiful princesses, none of them could bear a son for him. So then Angira said, “Ok if that is what you want, I will fulfil your desire but be sure that while your son will be the cause of your joy, he will also be the cause of your distress.” And he thought you know just as sometimes children are naughty and cause some distress, but after all I’ll get a son, so he was very happy. In due course of time, he got a son, but Chitraketu became so attached to the son and the mother of the son, Kritaduti, that Chitraketu started to neglect his other wives and not only did he neglect his other wives, but he also started to neglect his royal responsibilities. 
    
    So, the queens became very envious, ministers became concerned about how the kingdom will go on like this. And then these envious queens one day decided to poison the boy and they thought that if we kill this boy, then the king’s attention will be reverted towards us, so they poisoned the boy and when the boy died, the king was submerged in an ocean of agony along with the queen, Kritaduti. 
    
    At that time Rishi Angira came along with Narada Muni and the king was begging, “Please do something, please bring my son back to life.” So, Narada Muni said, “Ok, I’ll do that,” and he went and called the boy, “Why are you leaving? Don’t you see that your parents are in such anguish?” Then the boy came back to life, he sat up and he asked Narada Muni, “Which parents are you talking about? I had so many parents, but which ones are you talking about?”
    
    And just these words of wisdom from this boy enlightened the king. He realised the futility of material existence, we are here only for a short while. We take birth, stay here for some time, then we go and then again we come back and in this way it goes on and on and on, or it is going on since time immemorial. We all are travelling “yantrarudhani mayaya”; we are travelling in some machines that have been designed by maya. 
    
    This body is actually a machine, like a very wonderful motor car – far superior to a motor car. Motor cars are replicas of this machine. This human body has such incredible ability that no machine, no matter how sophisticated that machine is, will compare as nothing to this human body or any body as such. If we think about it a little deeply, we can see what a wonderful machine this is, and after all it is a machine. To give an example what a wonderful machine this is, the two machines get together and a third machine is produced, right? And in this way, it goes on and on and on. 
    
    Another kind of machine is the trees, one little fruit and inside the fruit there are thousands of seeds; like consider a fig and how many seeds are there in that fig and in each seed there is a tree, 
    
    there is a fig tree. In that tree, there are innumerable fruits and in each fruit there are thousands of seeds. 
    
    This is what Prabhupada told me once – Prabhupada had a prune and after eating the prune, Prabhupada held the seed in his hand and he told me, “Inside this, there is a tree, and in that tree there are innumerable fruits, and in each fruit there is a seed, and in that seed there is a tree, and in that tree there are innumerable fruits, and in those fruits there are seeds, and in that seed there is a tree,” and then Prabhupada said, “Can any scientist produce something like this, can they manufacture something like this – and still they want to compete with Krishna.”
    
    So, anyway this is how wonderful Krishna’s creation is and this is how wonderful our bodies are and in these bodies the soul is situated and then the soul travels according to the modes of material nature, “urdhvam gacchanti sattva-stha madhye tisthanti rajasah jaghanya-guna-vrtti- stha adho gacchanti tamasah”– those who are situated in the mode of goodness they go up, those who are in the mode of passion, they remain here, and those who have become affected by the abominable mode of ignorance, they go down to the lower species of life. 
    
    So, in this way, living entities are constantly travelling – sometimes going up, sometimes going down, like in a Ferris wheel. So, Chitraketu realised that, that living entities are just travelling in this body, in different bodies, in this way and we, due to our ignorance, become attached to those bodies, thinking that they are our children, or relatives, friends; so Chitraketu begged Narada Muni to bless him with spiritual knowledge and Narada Muni gave him the mantra and Chitraketu started to meditate on the mantra and by chanting on the mantra, Chitraketu was so elevated that he became the king of the Gandharvas and then he was travelling. He had the ability to travel throughout the universe in his personal spaceship, not spaceship, personal travelling planet; he had a planet of his own and the planet was travelling around. 
    
    And then while he was flying around in that way on his own planet, one day he saw Lord Shiva sitting with Parvati, surrounded by all exalted personalities; very, very exalted sages and brahmanas. And Lord Shiva was naked and Parvati was sitting on his lap. So Chitraketu smiled and said, “Look at him, he is sitting in such an exalted assembly but look at his state.” Lord Shiva did not mind that Chitraketu thought that way because Lord Shiva knew Chitraketu’s exalted position, so he didn’t mind that, but Parvati couldn’t tolerate that. Parvati immediately cursed Chitraketu, “Look at that impudent fool, he dares to speak like that, so I curse him that he will become a demon.”
    
    Of course before that Bhagavatam also explains that Chitraketu was actually so exalted that he could counter curse Parvati, because Parvati’s curse was not fair; because of the way Chitraketu perceived the behaviour of an exalted personality, from his point of view, he was right and that’s why Lord Shiva was silent; he didn’t say anything. 
    
    But Chitraketu, because he was a devotee of the Lord, just accepted it and that is the situation of a devotee – whether he is blessed, or he is cursed, he accepts both as the mercy of the Lord and then Chitraketu became a demon – Vritrasura – but he was so powerful a demon that he defeated Indra, he defeated Indra – took away his kingdom. 
    
    Now, Indra was in great distress and he wanted to do something to regain his kingdom, so he approached Vishnu Narayana and then Vishnu advised, “Ok, the only thing that can kill Chitraketu is thunder that can be made from the bones of a great sage called Dadhichi.” So Indra went to Dadhichi and asked him, “Will you kindly give me your bones because Vritra has to be killed and the only way he can be killed is by the thunder made out of your bones?” This way we can see Indra, who was not actually adept in the art of dying, behaved in such a way, like his only concern was his own selfish benefit. But, Dadhichi was so exalted a personality (he actually was a person who knew the art of dying) that he said, “Well, after all this body is temporary and eventually this body will become the food for insects and worms, so what if this body can be used in some good cause, why not?”
    
    So he gave his bones – that means he had to leave his body and with his body, thunder was made; Vishwakarma made the thunder and with becoming powerful with this thunder, Indra challenged Vritra to battle and Vritra knew that the Lord’s desire is that now he will die. But still as a Kshatriya, he accepted that situation, he came to the battlefield to fight with Indra, with his soldiers, his army and now becoming powerful with the thunder, the demigods became so powerful that their onslaught was unbearable for the demons – Vritra’s soldiers – and they started to run away from the battlefield and Vritra was standing alone in the battlefield still, ready to fight with Indra. And with his mace, he hit Indra so hard that Indra’s elephant, Airavata, took ten steps back and thunder fell out of Indra’s hand and Indra was completely baffled and embarrassed. 
    
    He was just standing there unarmed; Vritra could have killed him at that time but Vritra said, “It is not to be, like I know I am going to die in this battle, the thunder has been created to kill me. So Indra pick up the thunder; this is not the time to become baffled, pick up the thunder and come fight.”And then Indra picked up the thunder and the fight ensued and the fight was so terrible that Indra cut Vritra’s right hand; Vritra was fighting with his left hand – Indra cut off his left hand with his thunder. Then Vritrra was fighting with his legs and Indra cut off the legs of Vritra; then Vritra assuming a huge form, swallowed up Indra and Indra from within Vritra’s belly, cut open the belly with the thunder and came out and then he applied the thunder to cut Vritra’s head. 
    
    It took thunder three hundred and sixty five days to cut Vritra’s head. Now Sri Vishwanath Chakravati Thakur makes the point here, he said, “Actually, Vritra didn’t die, it’s Indra who died.” When Vritra swallowed up Indra, then he considered, “Well my job has been finished so now let me leave my body,” so he left his body and went to the abode of Shankarshana in the spiritual sky. So, this is another wonderful example of an individual from Srimad Bhagavatam who mastered the art of dying. 
    
    Now, what is the result of mastering this very special art from all these examples, all these anecdotes – what did you learn – that when one masters this art, what happens to him? He becomes immortal. And what is this art ultimately – remember Krishna all the time and never forget Him; especially at the time of difficulties, remember Krishna. Now one may be practising devotional service, one may be practising the art of mastering this subject but if he practises properly then he will be able to practically apply this art when the time comes. Thank you all very much. Hare Krishna.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p> Hare Krishna. So the last couple of days we have been discussing about ‘The Art Of Dying’, the way to immortality. If we know how to die, then we become immortal that means if we know how to die, then we can conquer death. And that is what Srimad Bhagavatam is teaching us. Srimad Bhagavatam or the Vedic scriptures are actually showing us the way to immortality. So Amrtitataya kalpate. Amritatya means immortality. Amrita means non-death, or immortality and amritattaya means the way to achieve that immortality. So the first day, that is the day before yesterday, we discussed about what death actually means and we concluded that death is to the body but the soul never dies. Therefore, as long as we indentify ourselves with the body we become susceptible to death. But when we recognize ourselves as the spirit soul, then we immediately transcend death or conquer death. And that is what Srimad Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures are teaching us. One of the first things that the Vedas are teaching us is that there are two things that we perceive in this world. One is inert matter and the other is living beings. Like if we analyze the world around us, then we can immediately consider that there are these two things. Some things are inert, and some things are living. BCS: “Right? Are you living, or are you inert?” Devotee: “Living.” BCS: “Very good. And this table is it living or inert?” Devotee: “Inert.” BCS: “Now what makes something inert, and what makes something living? Okay, let us put it this way. Say somebody is alive, somebody is living. And when that person dies, is he living or is he inert?” 

    www.bcswami.com   
    
                                                                                                                                              www.iskcondesiretree.com  
    
    Devotee: “Inert” BCS: Yes, the body becomes inert. Now what causes something to be alive and something to be dead? The presence of the soul and absence of the soul. Now this is a science that we must try to understand. And this is what the Vedas are actually teaching. The Vedic wisdom is mainly dealing with this science. The science of the spiritual reality. We have informations about material nature – like in different schools and colleges and the universities, we learn about this material world. But there is an acute lack of the informations about the spiritual reality, which is the most important thing. The Vedas consider that that is the most important knowledge. And not only the Vedas, the wise men, the wise people in the past, both in the East and West, both went to that area, like the science of the spiritual reality. Beyond this material nature there is another reality that is the spiritual reality. And the Vedas and other scriptures provide information about that reality. And when you receive proper information from those realities or when you understand that reality then we become situated in real knowledge. And what that knowledge does to us? That knowledge gives us immortality. Just by getting proper information we can very easily conquer death and become immortal. Nobody wants to die, nobody wants to die, but no one can avoid death. That is the mystery. Everybody or rather nobody wants to die, but everybody will be subjected to death, everybody will die. Now one simple question here is, or one simple consideration here is that why nobody wants to die? Why nobody wants to die? What will be the simple answer to that question? Why nobody wants to die? Yes Sita [Inaudible answer.] Right, because the soul is immortal. Soul never dies, and we are spirit souls. But the problem is that when we identify ourselves with the body, when we begin to think that this body is ourselves, and then we cannot avoid death. But the simplest way to avoid death, or conquer death, is by recognizing the fact that we are not this body but we are spirit souls. Our bodies are alive because the soul is in the body. As long as the soul is in the body then the body remains alive. As soon as the soul leaves the body, the body becomes dead. Isn’t it? I presume that everyone present here believes in the existence of soul. Does everyone believe in soul, the existence of the soul-please raise your hand. Okay, so it becomes easy for me to make my presentation. Okay, then yesterday we discussed about, we actually narrated the incidents or anecdotes of different personalities from Srimad-Bhagavatam who have mastered the art of dying.  Do you all remember who they are, who are the ones that we discussed yesterday? Yes, Sita, Gajendra-very good. Gajendra is an elephant – isn’t it amazing – even an elephant can master the art of dying? Right? Cintamani? Ajamila. Ratnavali? – Citraketu or Vrtrasura Tulasi. Prahlad Maharaja – very good Lalita? Druva Maharaja-okay (laughing). 
    
    So in this way we can see that Srimad Bhagavatam is actually giving a very very definite understanding of the individuals who conquered death and how they conquered death. Now comes the next question; what is the way to conquer death? What is the art of conquering death? Remember, the surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord. When we take shelter of Krishna, then we immediately conquer death. And Krishna takes care of that. We cannot take care of death-he is too strong of an enemy for us. He is too strong an enemy for us. So when you have a very strong enemy what’s the best way to defeat him? You join somebody or approach somebody who is stronger than your enemy and ask him to fight for you, right? Then very easily you can defeat your enemy. So the best way to defeat and conquer this enemy death is by taking shelter of Krishna.

    So today we are going to discuss about, I will tell you about how Prabhupada … How we saw Prabhupada teaching us how to master the art of dying and conquer death and attain immortality. And I’ll also tell you some other incidences that we have practically experienced and then, you all remember what I suggested yesterday. Then I will request you all to narrate some experiences that you may have. Like yesterday mother Krishna Priya narrated one incidence of some devotee’s mother how she actually conquered death. How many of you prepared yourself? Please raise your hands. How many of you have some stories to tell? Mother Krishna Priya, who else? Yes? Okay. Devaki, you have? Okay. So Accordingly I will make my presentation. 
    
    So we actually learned about this science or this art because of Srila Prabhupada. Personally, I can say that if I didn’t come across Srila Prabhupada I wouldn’t have known anything about this subject. Immortality of soul, surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, these were all very strange topics to be even been considered. But then somehow or other we came in contact with Srila Prabhupada and then by coming in contact with Srila Prabhupada and his devotees and reading Srila Prabhupada’s books we have been able to master this science. So Prabhupada is the first person who actually taught us this science. And Srila Prabhupada was a perfect teacher. How does a perfect teacher teach? The perfect teacher teaches by his own example. That’s why he is called ‘Acharya’. Acharya: acharan means to act, and one who teaches by his own action is called Acharya. He just doesn’t simply say do this and do that, but he practically demonstrates how to act. I will first narrate how I saw Srila Prabhupada teaching this very important subject. 
    
    In 1977 Srila Prabhupada’s health condition became quite bad and it started to deteriorate. Then one admirer of Srila Prabhupada, not one, two of them, they’re very important people, one was a governor of Madras and the other person was his brother in law, who was a very big industrialist in India. Ramakrishna Bajaj, he is the chairman of the Bajaj industries and his brother in law, Sriman Narayana, he was the governor of Madras. They came to see Srila Prabhupada in Bombay and when they saw Srila Prabhupada’s health condition was not so good, so they just suggested that Prabhupada went to Hrishikesh, on the bank of the Ganges at the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains. Prabhupada liked the idea and they made the arrangement for Srila Prabhupada to go there. They arranged one of the best houses there at that time, right on the bank of the Ganges, called ‘Ganga Darshan’. So few of us accompanied Srila Prabhupada. 
    
    And then we were having a beautiful time with Srila Prabhupada there. One night, at about one o’clock, I was attending to Srila Prabhupada. One of us used to be with Srila Prabhupada all the time. Especially at night we used to have our shifts and my shift was from twelve to two to be with Srila Prabhupada at night. Just in case Prabhupada needed something. So Prabhupada called me. He was lying in his bed and he called me and he told me that, “The time has come for me to leave my body, so I want to leave my body in Vrindavana. So please make arrangements for me to go to Vrindavana immediately.” So I ran downstairs and woke up Tamal Krishna Maharaja and told him what Prabhupada said. Tamal Krishna Maharaja immediately ran upstairs to Srila Prabhupada and Prabhupada told him the same thing that, “The time has come for me to leave my body and I want to leave my body in Vrindavana. So make arrangement for me to go to Vrindavana immediately.” 
    
    So that night only we packed everything up and in the morning we left for Vrindavana. On the way we stopped in Delhi and the next morning we left for Vrindavana. The devotees in 
    
    www.bcswami.com   
    
                                                                                                                                              www.iskcondesiretree.com  
    
    Vrindavana were very, very happy that Prabhupada came back all of a sudden. There were hundreds of devotees at that time and they were ecstatic that Prabhupada came back to Vrindavana. And then Prabhupada had the darshana of the Deities and after the darshana of the Deities Prabhupada went to his room and went to his house. There was a big room where Prabhupada used to give darshana and all the devotees followed Srila Prabhupada and there Srila Prabhupada broke the news why Srila Prabhupada came to Vrindavana. The ecstasy of all the devotees immediately turned into agony and they started to cry. And Prabhupada very mercifully kept on explaining that how this body is always changing. Prabhupada quoted this verse, Prabhupada first explained how death is inevitable for everyone and then Prabhupada quoted the verse from Bhagavad Gita, dehino’smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara tatha dehantara praptir dhiras tatra na muhyate [Bg. 2.13]. This body goes through different changes, from childhood to boyhood, to youth, to old age, but although the body changes, the person remains the same. We do not change. The body changes, but in spite of the change of the body, we do not change. But in spite of the change of the body, we do not change. Similarly, when we change this body all together, we continue to exist. We simply “tatha dehantara-praptih”: we get into another body. In this body the body goes through different changes. With time from childhood to boyhood to youth to old age. And then, when the body becomes old, and uninhabitable for the soul, then the soul leaves the body in order to take up another body. Srila Prabhupada explains “dhiras tatra na muhyati”. One who is dhira, one who is situated in real knowledge, he doesn’t become overwhelmed with these affairs of birth and death. Death doesn’t perturb a person who is situated in knowledge, in real knowledge. 
    
    When everyone left, Srila Prabhupada called me and told me not to force him to eat, and not to cook for him. He said, “what is the use of eating when there is no appetite?” So Srila Prabhupada just gave us the ultimatum, so as to say “don’t force me to eat anything”. That means Srila Prabhupada was going to fast. To me it occurred at that time that like Pariksit Maharaja now Srila Prabhupada was going to stop eating and in this way Srila Prabhupada would give up his body. There was nothing that we could do. I told Tamala Krishna Maharaja who was Srila Prabhupada’s secretary at that time, his main assistant. Both of us felt extremely helpless. What can we do, Srila Prabhupada just said that he is not going to eat anything. Srila Prabhupada is going to fast, and in this way Srila Prabhupada is going to give up his body. 
    
    Then devotees came from all around the world. The leading devotees gathered in Vrindavan. In just two, three days time they all converged in Vrindavan. They had a meeting. Since I was serving Srila Prabhupada I was not in that meeting. But after the meeting they all came, all the GBC’s and sannyasis, all the leading devotees. They came to Srila Prabhupada’s room. 
    
    [- Jaya Sri Sri Radha Golokananda ki Jaya -]. 
    
    Kirtanananda Maharaja presented to Srila Prabhupada. In a meeting it was discussed and decided that Srila Prabhupada is a pure devotee of Krishna. So if Srila Prabhupada desires something or wants something, then Krishna will comply. If Srila Prabhupada wanted to stay, then Krishna would let Srila Prabhupada stay. They considered if Srila Prabhupada left at that time, then what would happen to all of us. Already we were just like a bunch of children. If Srila Prabhupada left, we would become orphans and what would happen to us? Kirtanananda Maharaja presented that to Srila Prabhupada, he as the spokesman of all the devotees told Srila Prabhupada: “We are

                                                                                                                                              www.iskcondesiretree.com  
    
    your little children. We are so young in our spiritual life, and if you leave us at this time, then what will happen to us. Please stay, please don’t leave us. You’re a pure devotee of Krishna. If you want to stay on, then Krishna will obviously grant your desire.” Then Srila Prabhupada smiled and said “OK, then I’ll stay”. And all the devotees became so joyful. Srila Prabhupada also said at that time “but you all pray to Krishna – that Krishna, if You so desire then let Srila Prabhupada stay on with us.” 
    
    Srila Prabhupada, for the last three days didn’t eat or drink anything. But from time to time I used to make some fruit juice, just in case Srila Prabhupada wanted something. And Srila Prabhupada sat up and said “give me something to drink”. I had some grape juice ready, so I just gave it to him. Srila Prabhupada was very happy. He decided to stay. Srila Prabhupada started to eat also and I started to cook for Srila Prabhupada. 
    
    Then one day after eating, taking his lunch Srila Prabhupada was sitting. Srila Prabhupada used to take his lunch sitting on a seat like this and there used to be a table. Srila Prabhupada used to eat from that table. He was just sitting on that table and asked me whether I knew where Gopinath Bazar was in Vrindavan. That was my first visit to Vrindavan. I didn’t know. I never even stepped out of the temple. But I told Srila Prabhupada, tell me what you want, and I can find out. Srila Prabhupada said: “Go to Gopinath Bazar. There is an Ayurvedic doctor called Banumalika Viraja and you ask him to come. He knows me, he treated me earlier. Ask him to come and treat me”. I went and found Banumalika Viraja. He was a very old man, over 90, I think at that time he was 92 years old. When I told him that Srila Prabhupada wanted him to come, he said: “look, I can’t go anywhere. I just come from house to my clinic. I just give my prescription and medicines from here, but I can’t go anywhere”. I told him, I will take you in a rickshaw. He said: “Rickshaw? With every bump of the rickshaw my bones will crack”. He was really a very old man. Then I begged him:  “Please come, Srila Prabhupada wanted you to come”. Finally he agreed and complied. He came. He checked Srila Prabhupada and then he considered that the medicine that he would give, he will have to make them; make the medicine just before giving it to Srila Prabhupada. I told him: “Then you can stay in our guesthouse. We will make all the arrangements for you”. He said: “No I can’t stay here. I have to go back home to my place”. Then I told him: “you can show me how to make the medicine and I can make it”. He accepted that idea. He took me to the field and he showed me two types of leaves, two plants. One plant is called punarnava, and the other is called patharkuchi. He showed me how to take the juice out of these leaves and then he gave two salts. He asked me to mix the salt in the juice and give it to Srila Prabhupada. 
    
    Srila Prabhupada’s condition started to improve. He got better. But when Srila Prabhupada got better, he was feeling restless. Srila Prabhupada didn’t want to stay in Vrindavan like that lying in bed. He wanted to go to preach to the West. I told that to Banumalika Viraja that Srila Prabhupada is planning to leave. He said: “Please don’t let him go now.  The medicine is working. His health condition is improving. During winter I’ll give him a medicine called makaratach and that will rejuvenate him. That will build him up. But it is a very strong medicine. He won’t be able to digest that medicine now. By that time his health will improve and also the cold of the winter will help him to retain that medicine.” So I told Tamal Krishna Maharaja that Banumalika Viraja is saying that. Tamal Krishna Maharaja told me that: “look, Srila Prabhupada wants to go, so what to do?”

                                                                                                                                              www.iskcondesiretree.com  
    
    Then Srila Prabhupada finally decided to go.  He decided to go to London, and then from London to New York; from New York to the West Coast, and from Los Angeles to Hawaii. He wanted to stay in Hawaii and translate Srimad Bhagavatam. So when Srila Prabhupada decided to leave, one couldn’t stop him actually. But of course later on I often used to lament that why didn’t I become a little more forceful, and tell the other senior devotees, the GBC members that the doctor said this, that Srila Prabhupada shouldn’t travel. But at that time I was very new in the movement. I was very young in that respect. And also at that time there was no way of knowing that Srila Prabhupada’s condition could deteriorate so much. The day Srila Prabhupada was leaving, he asked me. Srila Prabhupada was all dressed up at night, and he was sitting in this rocking chair in his room, and I was sitting at his feet. Srila Prabhupada asked me: “aren’t you coming?” I said: “No, Srila Prabhupada, I don’t have my passport with me”. Then Srila Prabhupada said: “ok, then you join me in Hawaii”. 
    
    So at that time anyway Srila Prabhupada left and I went back to Mayapur. Actually Bhavananda Maharaja came to Vrindavan and he also went to the airport to see Srila Prabhupada off. After that he asked me: “what are you going to do now?” I said: “I didn’t have any plans”. He said: “let’s go to Mayapur”. So he and I went to Mayapur. I stayed in Mayapur for about 10 days or 12 days. Then I received one afternoon – I was giving a class of Nectar of Devotion to the new bhaktas. I received a telegram that said Srila Prabhupada was in Vrindavan. The same day, the next morning I went to Delhi, and then I went to Vrindavan. Srila Prabhupada went back, his health condition deteriorated in London. So he cancelled his plan to travel and he went back to India. First he went to Bombay, and then to Vrindavan. 
    
    When I arrived in Vrindavan, it was evening. Upendra prabhu who was Srila Prabhupada’s servant, he told me that Srila Prabhupada had some cold, and some medicine had been given to Srila Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada was taking rest, he was sleeping. And he [Upendra prabhu] said : come in. So he took me to Srila Prabhupada’s room. The room was quite dark, there was a dim light and it was full of frank incense. I saw Srila Prabhupada was lying on his bed, and I could see his body became so thin, that it looked as if it was on the same level with the bed. His head was propped on that pillow. At one time Srila Prabhupada woke up coughing. Upendra prabhu went to Srila Prabhupada and told him that I came. Srila Prabhupada told him to ask me to come to him. I went there to Srila Prabhupada’s bed. Srila Prabhupada asked me to help him sit up. So I helped him to sit up, and then with the pillows I propped him so that he could sit. I could see that Srila Prabhupada became so thin. I told him: “Srila Prabhupada, you became so thin”. Srila Prabhupada said: “yes, now this body is just a set of bones in a bag of skin”. It was indeed a set of bones in a bag of skin. He became so emaciated. Srila Prabhupada became so thin and weak, at that time he couldn’t even turn to his side. We had to help him to turn to his side. If we were not careful enough, then Srila Prabhupada would feel pain if we did not handle him carefully enough. 
    
    But still Srila Prabhupada was translating Srimad Bhagavatam. The last few chapters of Srimad Bhagavatam that Srila Prabhupada translated 10, 11, 12, 13d were actually in that state, lying on his bed. He used to just lie down on his bed and Pradyumna prabhu who was Srila Prabhupada’s Sanskrit editor, he used to write the Sanskrit verses and Srila Prabhupada used to give the translation and the purports of the verses. And one devotee, often it was Jayadvaita Maharaja who used to hold the microphone of the Dictaphone in front of Srila Prabhupada’s mouth.

                                                                                                                                              www.iskcondesiretree.com  
    
    Pradyumna prabhu used to recite the verses and Srila Prabhupada used to translate. This is how Srila Prabhupada taught us how to serve Sri Krishna irrespective of physical condition. The last drop of his energy was used in serving Krishna, serving His mission. In this way Srila Prabhupada actually taught us how to leave this body; how to prepare ourselves. That time Srila Prabhupada’s health condition did not deteriorate that much. I used to cook for Srila Prabhupada, but Srila Prabhupada could not eat. He used to make an effort – one or two bites, but he couldn’t even swallow that. 
    
    One day Srila Prabhupada told me: “why are you wasting your time cooking for me while you have so many things to do?” He said: “let somebody else cook, you don’t have to cook”. I told Srila Prabhupada: “I cook with an expectation that someday you would like to eat something. Some day you would feel better and you would like to eat something”. Srila Prabhupada said: “I will only get better when I die”. And just that statement was so, it came to me with such a shocking effect that I broke down. Very affectionately, full of compassion, Srila Prabhupada started to speak. He said: “Is this what I taught you? Didn’t I teach you that this body is perishable but the soul is eternal, and the soul never dies”? In this way Srila Prabhupada spoke, explaining the immortality of the soul. 
    
    When Srila Prabhupada left his body, also it was very exemplary. But I don’t want to get into that. But a few things that Srila Prabhupada told, I want to mention here. One thing Srila Prabhupada said that if I become unconscious I don’t want to be taken to the hospital. And he said that nothing should pierce his body, no needle, no drips, nothing should pierce his body. His body should be completely untouched. And sometimes some very strange things used to happen. Like one doctor was treating Srila Prabhupada, his name is Damodar Prasad Sastri, he was brought from Kolkata, and he was also an ayurvedic doctor. So Damodar Prasad once was telling to Prabhupada: “Prabhupada, I can’t understand you.” He said; “Sometimes your heart is so feeble and faint that it seems that it is going to stop, but the next moment I see your heart is strong as a young man’s heart.”He said this is all your pastimes. So in this way, this doctor also made us realize, that all Prabhupada was doing his pastimes. He was not subject to the condition of this body. This is how we can understand that a pure devotee although dwells in his body, remains in his body but he is not affected by the body; rather his body becomes spiritualized. 
    
    In this way what Srila Prabhupada thought us is actually how to die, how to leave our body. His whole teaching was based on that. His most emphatic teaching was you are not your body, you are a spirit soul. Time and time again, Srila Prabhupada made this point very clear, you are not your body you are spirit soul. Prabhupada would just stick to this one point, tenaciously. You are not this body, you are spirit soul. And now we see if we understand just this fact, if we can realize this fact, so most of our problems will be solved, and we will become situated in our spiritual identity. 
    
    And we see how different individuals have been affected by Srila Prabhupada’s teachings. I want to mention just two incidences. One is a very simple Gujarati lady in London, she is not a big scholar, she is not a front line devotee, and she is just a simple house wife. In 1998, the doctors detected that she got cancer and it was quite at an advanced stage, and the doctor told her husband and daughter, and did not tell her and they were quite worried how to break the news to her, that she had cancer and she had at the most six months and finally when they told her she 
    
    www.bcswami.com   
    
                                                                                                                                              www.iskcondesiretree.com  
    
    was completely unaffected by that. Her husband was more affected by this news than her, he was completely devastated actually. Then her condition improved from time to time and when her condition improved, she would go to the temple and render some service. Although she had cancer, she did not have much time and it was in a quite advanced stage, but she was completely unaffected by that. Not only that she travelled to Vrndavan and Mayapur and she wanted to just stay in Mayapur, then they phoned me and told me that she is planning to stay in Mayapur but the problem is, she has to go back to London to continue with the treatment, because those treatments were not available in India. So I told her and she complied, she went back to London. She was still with us till the summer of 2000 and at that time I was in New Vrndavan, shooting for Abhay Charan, New Vrndavan’s episode. I used to speak to her from time to time. I used to phone her from time to time, and I was told that the doctor said that she had maximum about 7 days, that is what her daughter told me. When I was speaking to her she just mentioned that the night before she had a dream and she saw that I came, that I was there. And when I heard that it was her last desire and she was going to leave her body, I decided that I will go to see her. 
    
    So I dropped everything and I took a flight to London. So when I arrived there, those who came to pick me up, they told me that they are driving me to the place where I will be staying then I would see her at about three o’clock in the afternoon after I have rested a little. I said: “No. I will just go straight, I came to see her let me just go and see her.” So I was going there, I thought she will be bed ridden and completely unable to move, but when I arrived there she just got out of her bed to offer obeisances. I tried to stop her but she would not stop. She just got out of her bed and offered obeisances. Her main consideration was that she is not the body, so she does not care what happens to the body. This is the profundity and the effect of Srila Prabhupada’s teachings. She realized although she is not a very educated person, although she is not a big devotee in that sense, although philosophically she is not very knowledgeable probably, but she understood this point that she is not her body, she is a spirit soul. So she was not at all affected by the body’s incompetence’s. 
    
    I went there on 27th of July; finally she left her body on the 20th of August. I was not there; I had to go back to New Vrndavan because we were in the middle of the shooting. I stayed there for four to five days and then went back. I was told and I saw the picture also that, when she was leaving her body, she was chanting the Holy Name. At the time of leaving her body, she had a bead bag in her hands, and she took the bead bag, placed it on her forehead and she left her body.  Now what kind of, not only conviction, but spiritual realization I would say, one must have to leave one’s body in this way? 
    
    Another person that I often think of, who also left her body in a very exemplary way; a young girl she was probably 23 to 24, a girl from Pune. They used to live in Bombay before and then they shifted to Pune. She is a disciple of Radhanath Maharaja. Her name is Shyama Sundari. She was a very very vibrant young girl. I first met her in 1997 and she was like enthusiasm personified; at that time probably she was 16, she was still in school, 16, 17 maybe even younger and she had an elder sister who was very sober , calm and grave, but the younger sister was completely opposite, she was extremely vibrant and full of life, full of enthusiasm. Recently about 2 years back, she developed some sort of complication of the stomach. There was no cure for that, there was no allopathic cure. They tried everything, and then ayurvedic, homeopathic; I think there was some result from the ayurvedic or homeopathic treatment and her condition 
    
    www.bcswami.com   
    
                                                                                                                                              www.iskcondesiretree.com  
    
    improved a little bit. And few months ago and then when that happened to her, she had completely changed, she became very grave, very profound also, she used to. One day I was talking to her and she was telling me, that well I have accepted that it is going to happen, I know I am going to die and it does not really matter, I am not afraid; and it was so enlivening to hear such words of wisdom from such a young girl then her condition improved; although her condition improved, but her nature, she remained the same. Like she did not get back to her vibrant self anymore, she was very composed and very serene. And recently she actually left her body and this happened very suddenly. She was alright and she appeared in her exams. She did her final year at university, that day she got her result and she was telling to her mom and her mother was telling how she was proud of her. She did very well in her studies. And all of a sudden she got this pain in her stomach, she was taken to the hospital; they could not do anything because her internal bleeding started and they could not do anything. They put her into intensive care and she was unconscious with oxygen and everything and then she came back to her external consciousness, she asked them to take off the oxygen and all that she had in her body, like drips, “Please take this out, I don’t want that.” She asked the devotees who were there at that time to chant the Holy Name and just for that brief moment of consciousness she gained she just made the arrangement, ask everybody to chant, she took off the oxygen, she took off the drips and she also started to chant herself and she left her body. Now this is the real proof of the authenticity of what Srila Prabhupada gave and this is how one actually attains immortality, conquering death. 
    
    There are many such others instances, two other instances. I was not there when he passed away, like is Upendra Prabhu. Upendra Prabhu was Prabhupada’s servant, we served Srila Prabhupada together and he was a wonderful, wonderful servant, but he had a wild mind, he was quite wild that Prabhupada sometimes would chastise him and anyway he had problems with his mind and senses. Soon after Prabupada left, Upendra just disappeared, no one knew. Only once I met him, he came to Mayapur and I just saw him. But he felt deep into Maya and then he developed some disease, incurable disease and when he realized he was going to die, although he was far? far away from the devotees’ community, he just arrange to come to the devotees’ community, he went to Murilumba, New Govardhan in Australia and devotees also were very supportive, so they took care of him very nicely and he left his body, hearing the holy Name and chanting the Holy Name. 
    
    So we can see although he was so far away from Srila Prabhupada’s lotus feet at that time. And this is how the devotees actually make or create the good fortune for others. And that’s why association of devotees is so important. At the time of death it’s going to be very, very difficult. We lose our consciousness, we wouldn’t know where to go, how to direct our mind, how to direct our consciousness. But if we remain in the association of devotees then they will help us. So in this way Upendra prabhu left, chanting the holy name, hearing the holy name in the association of devotees. There are so many such wonderful examples. Another person that I just remember is, he’s a God-brother, he was a sannyasi before; Sudama Maharaja. He also left the association of devotees after Srila Prabhupada’s disappearance. But when he realized that time is nearing he came back to the association of devotees and I heard that he also left his body in a wonderful wonderful way.

    Devotee: “I had a question Guru Maharaja. You were with Srila Prabhupada when he left his body and you accompanied him for a long time; you were very close to him. What would you say was the greatest I (unclear) before you personally I (unclear).” 
    
    BCS: “That this material nature, our existence in the material nature and our involvement with this material objects is not important at all. Srila Prabhupada, I didn’t get into when Srila Prabhupada left his body; ah like the most important thing that Srila Prabhupada indicated through his final pastimes, was his implicit and total attachment to the holy Name. Anyways I didn’t, I thought that I wouldn’t go into describing Srila Prabhupada’s final pastimes because sometime it becomes a very painful thing to describe and narrate. But anyway I will just try to say it in brief. In the morning we got to know that Srila Prabhupada will leave his body, the doctor who came from Calcutta, Damodara Prasad, he said that Prabhupada will be with us for about ten hours. No I’m sorry, fourteen hours, it was five o’clock. It was quite precise actually, and Srila Prabhupada stayed with us for another fourteen hours; and he said something like twelve to fourteen hours Prabhupada would be with us. Generally Prabhupada’s room was kept very, very quiet and peaceful like very few people were allowed in Prabhupada’s room those days. And in groups some devotees would come and chant and the chanting would also be very soft. And but that morning it was decided that let everybody come. And so the room was packed with devotees. 
    
    There were hundreds of devotees in Vrindavan at that time. Many, many devotees were just standing there, those who couldn’t come in they were watching from outside through the window. In my experience that was the sweetest and the most profound kirtan I had ever heard, it was out of this world. And I was actually standing by Prabhupada’s bed, towards the head of Srila Prabhupada and from time to time I was giving him the water, Yamuna water. Prabhupada would open his mouth. See at five o’clock from the morning till the evening for fourteen hours I just stood there. I didn’t feel any other, you know, need of the body and I don’t also know that how time actually went by, as if I was transported to another reality where the body didn’t exist. 
    
    And then Prabhupada’s, some of Prabhupada’s God-brothers came and they were sitting near Prabhupada’s bed. And very close to Srila Prabhupada’s bed was Krishnadas Babaji Maharaja. He’s is a God-brother of Srila Prabhupada, a very wonderful devotee, and Srila Prabhupada was very intimate very close with him. And so Babaji Maharaja at one point just pointed out, see he’s still chanting. See, I couldn’t understand that at that time. But when Babaji Maharaja told that then I could see that Prabhupada’s tongue was still vibrating, it was not and I mean that the tongue was moving and Babaji Maharaja pointed out that Prabhupada was chanting the Holy Name. And in this way, chanting the holy Name Prabhupada left his body. 
    
    So as you asked what’s the most important lesson I learnt is that ultimately the most important consideration is to be attached to the holy Name and continue to chant the holy Name. And Prabhupada himself used to say that a devotee should chant his, chant the holy Name of the Lord at the time of death. anta-kale ca mam eva , Prabhupada pointed out time and time again. And Prabhupada personally demonstrated that, that he was chanting and also Prabhupada mentioned that the devotee leaves his body through his mouth. The sinful people leave their body through the lower part of the body, and the devotee leaves his body through his mouth. And true to Srila Prabhupada’s statement, we saw that how Prabhupada actually left his body through the mouth.

                                                                                                                                              www.iskcondesiretree.com  
    
    He was chanting the Holy name and his mouth was still open when he left his body. And Srila Prabhupada taught us and we can see that those who are following Srila Prabhuapda’s instructions sincerely, they also leave their bodies in such a wonderful way. 
    
    Like as I was speaking about Shyamasundari, as mother Devaki also heard about her, she was, her parents are, their parents live in Pune, that’s why they got to know about that. And she’s just a young girl, but considers that how much faith she had on the holy Name and that she, you know she took off all the, oxygen and all the things that were there to prolong her stay here, she just took them off and she took the shelter of the holy Name. And chanting the holy Name herself she left her body. Thank you all so much. 
    
    And I, I was wondering how a seminar of this nature, this the first time I gave this seminar, and it was also quite a spontaneous decision to give this seminar, because couple of weeks back when I met mother Krishna Priya in New Vrindavan, we were planning about the Bhagavatam seminar and how we would cover Srimad Bhagavatam in four days or five days. And then I just decided that I’m going to give a seminar on this topic. And I spoke to mother Krishna Priya and she also liked the idea. And I think that this was actually a real seminar on Srimad-Bhagavatam, because this is what Bhagavatam is teaching us. 
    
    Bhagavatam  is not just some stories, but all that Srimad-Bhagavatam is describing is simply to give this realization that, that we have to take shelter of Krishna and the most important time that we, we display our attachment to Krishna or conviction at Krishna’s lotus feet is at the time of death. And life is a period for preparation for that final test. We are preparing now to remember Krishna at the time of death. And in this way the real application of the teachings of Srimad- Bhagavatam is to constantly prepare ourselves or as often as we can remind ourselves of this importance. Like if have to die now, what shall I do? If I have to die now where shall my mind be? What shall I think of? And the answer is very simple, take full shelter of Krishna’s lotus feet and not look back, not look back. Don’t think of anything or anybody in this material nature, just think of Krishna and His devotees, and then our way back to the spiritual sky will be very very easy. And the gate of the spiritual sky will open up wide; will become wide open for us to go back there at the lotus feet of Krishna. 
    </p><p>
    Prabhupada pointed, Prabhupada sometimes mentioned that it’s something like waking up in the spiritual sky. At that time if we remember Krishna, when we are leaving our body, then we see Krishna face to face. All of a sudden at that time when we are leaving our body we see that Krishna is standing there or Krishna’s Vishnudutas or Krishna’s messengers are standing there. And then we feel that this is what we had been waiting for all our life and now it happened. How ecstatic that experience is going to be? All our lives we are just trying to be with Krishna, trying to see Krishna, trying to serve Krishna and there comes the ultimate opportunity. He’s there, He says come, come back. So thank you all very much. I felt very content very satisfied after this or I can say that I am very happy after this seminar because I can see the result of the seminar. Thank you all very much. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML=`<p>Brahmacharya is the topic I have chosen for this seminar. I haven’t seen many devotees discussing about this topic though it’s a very important one. Brahmacharya: “brahma aacharati iti”. Brahma means “spiritual reality” and aacharan means “conduct”. So Brahmacharya literally means to act in such a way to become situated in spiritual reality. In English, Brahmacharya means celibacy i.e., to remain single or unmarried. But, according to Vedic understanding, celibacy could be one aspect of it but not all.

    We have two identities namely, material (body) and spiritual (soul). This body is basically a lump of matter and yet it has life in it because of the presence of the soul. Hence we understand that our real identity is spiritual. Brahmacharya is basically to become situated in that identity. When one practises Brahmacharya one automatically becomes a celibate. Therefore the Vedic understanding of Brahmacharya is far greater than being a celibate i.e., even householders can be Brahmacharis. Basically, this Krsna conscious movement is to make people Brahmacharis whether he or she is a man or a woman or a householder.
    
    Now let us consider this spiritual identity. As stated before, this body (lump of matter) is alive as long as the soul is present. So, the soul is the source of consciousness. When we say “I”, it actually refers to the soul. But due to our misconception, we tend to misidentify it as our body which is the source of bondage. It is through this body that the soul is bound to the material nature. When the soul is projected through the body, one thinks one-self to be the body and consequently he acts in a way that is detrimental to his spiritual identity. One example is that when a mosquito bites a person, he thinks that the mosquito is biting “him”. In this way, the soul becomes subjected to the pleasures and pain caused by his body. In the Bhagavad Gita, this body is compared to a dress. Just as when one dress becomes old with time we give that up and accept a new dress, the soul also assumes different bodies in course of time. But one difference between the dress and the body is that the body has senses to perceive information. The senses carry the information and register it in the brain through the nervous system. Therefore, if somebody pinches or tickles you, you feel it through the lump of matter.
    
    This body is subjected to different types of sense gratification namely, eating, sleeping, defending and mating. These propensities are even found in animals and in fact, it is stronger in them. For example, the animals generally wander in search of food and once they have found their prey, they rest. Yet they are always aware of the different threats from which they have to protect themselves by defending. And when the season is appropriate, they have the propensity for mating. Hence, according to Vedic scriptures, all these propensities are understood to be animal propensities. Man is also considered to be an animal but a civilized one. Man lives in a house while animals live in the forest. Animals defend themselves with their claws and fangs while man defends himself with mightier weapons. But in mating, there is a subtle difference. Mating in animals is controlled by nature’s arrangement whereas the man is allowed to mate whenever he wants. This freedom is endowed upon man to overcome the urges of his sex-desire and not to indulge in it indiscriminately. The urge is present in human being by the arrangement of nature. This is done so, in order to maintain the progeny by procreation. 
    
    Procreation is a very troublesome and painful experience. Nature awards some pleasure in it so that man and woman will mate which otherwise would not be possible. It is unfortunate that the present human society has given up this real purpose of procreation and indulges in it just for some sense gratification. Hence, it is important to act just for the purpose of it and not get deviated which can only be achieved by becoming aware of our spiritual practices. In the present society, the innocent people are getting drowned into sexual indulgence indiscriminately because of bad association. Sex-pleasure is believed to be the highest kind of pleasure in the material platform. But, one has to understand that everything in material-nature comes with a price-tag along with it. The price one pays for such ephemeral sense-gratification is loss of one’s vitality. This vital or life energy is Sanskrit is termed as “veerijya” or “shugra” popularly known as semen in English. 
    
    Semen is essence of Life-energy which comes from soul. It is a combination of two processes. The matter is consumed by the living-entity in the form of food. This food is transformed into different elements of the body by the supervision of the spirit-soul which also activates different organisms. These organisms accordingly, extract different elements from the food. There are three critical systems necessary for the proper functioning of the different organisms namely, respiratory system, circulatory system and digestive system. Respiratory system helps in assimilating the oxygen as we breathe in the air, while the circulatory system carries this life energy and circulates it throughout the body. After the life energy has been delivered to different parts of the body, it comes back to the heart where the vital-energy is re-infused into it. The digestive system helps in burning the food (the fire in stomach is called “jataradhmi”) to extract the juice from it. The burning process is called the digestive process. According to Vedic-science, food is transformed in seven stages (saptha dhatus). First, the food or the matter we consume is transformed into juice (rasa), which is then transformed into blood (raktha). This blood is then transformed into flesh (maamsha), which again transforms into fat (meedha). The fat is transformed into bone, which in turn is transformed into bone-marrow. Finally, the bone-marrow is converted into semen. Semen is the finest element and storehouse of vital energy. In Sanskrit semen is called “veeriya “, which also means strength. Thus, the essence of a living entity is semen, just like the essence of milk is butter. When we churn the transformed milk, we get butter. Similarly, when a living entity is agitated with sex-desire, its life-energy comes out of a specific-organ. The milk whose butter has been churned out is practically of no use. The condition of living-entity which has lost its life-energy is analogous to that of the churned milk. Thus, we see that it is very important for a living entity to retain its vital energy. It is interesting to note that in modern day especially people who participate in Olympics are advised by their trainers to not to indulge in sex before the contest. Here we see that even materialists are recognizing the importance of the retention of vital-energy, what to speak of a spiritual enthusiast. Hence we conclude that only householders should indulge just for the sake of procreation. Then, even they are also Brahmacharis.
    
    Sex-desire as already stated is the nature’s arrangement to make man and woman mate. It’s a very strong desire and most difficult hurdle for a spiritualist. Among the four regulative-principles it is very easy to follow the three regulative-principles namely, to avoid meat-eating, gambling and intoxication, the propensity for which gradually fades away with time. On the other hand, the more one restricts his sex-desire, the more it becomes strong. According to Vedic scriptures, it is by this desire a living-entity is chained to material-nature. As long as we have this desire, we will not be free from the bondage of material-nature. This bondage is created by Maya-devi. The more one elevates, the more he is subjected to it. For example, the arrangement for mating is much sophisticated in upper-planetary systems compared to Earth planet. When a living entity is about to leave the material-nature, Maya-devi Herself comes and tries to hold it back. Our acharyas have pointed out what ought to be done in that situation. One example is that when Bhaktha Kumar was about to leave Earth planet, Maya-devi Herself came and stopped him. Bhaktha Kumar replied “Please bless me so that I can serve Your Brother”. Thus, one should always pray to Maya-devi to be engaged in Krsna’s service. Srila Prabhupada pointed out that the jnanis and yogis try to artificially suppress this desire, whereas the real conquest is to shed this desire. One such example is, when a husband and wife beget a child, all their lust is transformed into love for their child. Therefore a living entity should develop a love for Krsna(higher taste)so as to conquer his sense-gratifying desires. 
    
    In reality, this process of procreation is disgusting and yet necessary. This is the basis of illusion. First of all, we misidentify ourselves to be the body and as a result a male body is enamored by the female body and vice versa. In actuality, we are part and parcel of Krsna. We are connected to him by love which is energy. When this energy is diverted on something, the tendency of the spirit-soul is to become united with it. When it is directed on material object, it wants to become one with that and is called Lust while when it is projected towards Krsna, its called devotion. To express this love, we perform activities called devotional service. This love is two-way traffic. Krsna also reciprocates multifold times which lead to a loving exchange. This causes one to become joyful which is actually what a living-entity is hankering for all his life-time. So, when one follows this path, all other desires become secondary. Just as a child is very much interested in building a castle with sand, while it grows up all these desires become insignificant. Similarly, when one grows out of material platform and develop spiritual consciousness, all his sense-gratifying desires become immaterial. In this regard, men have a very important responsibility to learn and respect women. The onus is on men as they are the natural aggressors. Unfortunately, the modern society doesn’t know how to respect women which only leads to complete degradation. But Srila Prabhupada established this society where men give the highest respect to women. It is our duty to establish and spread this spiritual culture. 
    
    Thank you all very much. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. Does any body have any question?
    
    Q: Is there copulation relationship in spiritual world?
    
    A: No. One has to get rid of this desire to enter spiritual world. Doesn’t it sound illogical if it exists there? But there is love for Krsna, which when we develop inundates our heart with joy. Material world is perverted reflection of spiritual world. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is Radha-Krsna together, who came to distribute the highest love of spiritual sky and not lust. Apparently, they may look alike but they are completely different as sun-rise and sun-set though looks alike, in reality are the opposite things. 
    
    Q: Initially, it is easy to conquer one’s sex-desire but eventually it becomes stronger. Comment. 
    
    A: It is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam that one can conquer these desires by devotional service. That’s what I had earlier pointed out as well. Initially, one doesn’t have strong desire. But when one restrains from that the vital energy keeps increasing in his body. And as it increases, the urge becomes greater. But when one develops Krsna consciousness he experiences some joy, but not attracted. Because he is elevating from material platform where the highest pleasure is sex-desire to spiritual platform where the highest pleasure is the loving exchange. So, one should try to be situated in spiritual platform.
    
    Q: When sex desire is suppressed can it come out as some other desire like overeating?
    
    A: Good point. Yes. That’s why the artificial suppression is discouraged. One must follow the natural process that is Krsna consciousness. And in Krsna consciousness one can eat as much as he wants. There is no restrain on that.
    
    Q: How do you explain the appearance of little infants in spiritual world?
    
    A: They don’t appear but manifest. It is not that those infants manifested day-before- yesterday. It is by Krsna’s will that everything manifests. Also everything in spiritual sky is eternal.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>I would like to summarize that we discussed yesterday. As stated earlier, Brahmacharya doesn’t mean just being a celibate. Brahmacharya means to become situated in one’s spiritual identity. The real import or the understanding is to become situated on the spiritual platform. This body is made of matter which is conscious due to the presence of the spirit-soul. This process of the soul assuming a body is a very intricate scientific process. First, the spirit-soul enters the womb of the mother and develops a body. The growth of the body depends on the food intake. In a deeper consideration, this food is actually matter or juice that a tree extracts from the earth. Trees transform the juice of the earth into stems, leaves etc. Humans consume this food and after a series of transformation semen (veeriya), the vital energy is formed. Semen has basically two functions: i) to retain the spiritual energy and ii) to carry the spirit-soul in the dormant state into the womb of the mother. Therefore, it is essential to retain the vital energy to make spiritual progress.




    The importance of retention of vital energy is emphasized in various religions apart from Vedic scriptures. We considered the example of milk and butter to elucidate the relationship between vital energy and semen. Butter is spread thorough out the milk. But when it is churned, the butter gets separated from the milk, leaving the remnant milk practically useless. Similarly, the “veeriya” or the vital energy is spread throughout the body. When the living entity is agitated with lust, the vital energy is discharged through a specific organ which is disastrous for the spiritual progress. 
    
    
    
    
    Spirit-soul is the spiritual energy that gives consciousness to the body. Wherever there is consciousness we understand the presence of spirit-soul, just as wherever there is light there is fire associated with it. The spiritual energy flows in the direction of the projection of consciousness. If it is projected towards matter, the spiritual energy flows through the mind to the senses and finally, to the object of senses. In the Bhagavad Gita, Krsna explains that senses run after the object of senses and as result of this association, grows lust. The desire to exploit the object of the sense as the spiritual energy flows to it is called lust. As a result, the carrier of spiritual energy called “veeriya” or vital energy also flows in that direction. On the other hand, if the spiritual energy is projected towards Krsna, it flows towards Him. Understandably, there is so much importance given to fix our mind on Krsna. Thus the loss of vital energy causes death while the retention of the same causes immortality. The vital energy if projected towards Krsna, becomes further spiritualized. Just as the affection of mother for her child transforms her blood into milk, the love of the living entity for Krsna, transforms into nectar. This nectar inundates our heart and transforms into joy. Therefore, celibacy is just a bye-product of Brahmacharya which is meant for everybody. In Krsna consciousness all are Brahmacharis. 
    
    
    
    
    Now let’s consider the exemplary Brahmacharis like Brahma Himself who created four sons out of His mind (4 Kumaras), who were also perfect Brahmacharis. The four Kumaras remain eternally as young boys. He created 10 sons, among which nine became prajapathis to procreate and fill in the universe. But the youngest, Narada Muni abstained from household life and stayed Krsna conscious. Narada Muni is a perfect Brahmachari and eventually became a pure devotee of Krsna. Once Narada Muni was approached by the daughter of Time personified. He politely declined and consequently attained an eternal life. Hence when one is situated in one’s spiritual identity i.e., becomes a Brahmachari, becomes free from death. Another exemplary personality is BhismaDev. When BhismaDev got to know the desire of his father to marry the daughter of King of fisherman, who demanded BhismaDev to relinquish the throne and remain unmarried, BhismaDev immediately swore to remain a life-long celibate. When his father came to know the vow of BhismaDev, he blessed him that he would die only when he wishes to. Therefore, retention of vital energy is necessary for protracted life-span although no one is immortal in this material world. Another role-model is Hanuman who is the son of Anjana and Pavan-Dev. He is a pure devotee of the Lord assuming the form of monkey in Lord Ram Chandra’s pastimes. Hanuman performed miraculous feat by jumping from India to SriLanka and carrying a mountain to SriLanka. Another female Brahmacharini is Vedavati who performed severe austerities to get Supreme Personality of Godhead as her husband. Sita devi is Vedavati in her previous life. Ravana approached her which she politely declined. He still kept molesting her and touched her at one point. She was so chaste that she burnt herself and cursed Ravana that she would be the cause of his death. There are also other great Brahmacharinis like Maitreya gargi. She was so learned that she challenged the great sage Jagyavarga in the assembly of King Janak. In the recent past, there is Meera Bhai who accepted Krsna as her husband at a young age. But she was given in marriage to King of Rana, who tried to dissuade her. Later, he gave poison to kill her which she drank and digested it. She left home and got initiated by Jiva Goswami and later became a pure devotee of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Being fixed up on our goal not only solves our problems, but leads us to experience endless joy.
    
    
    
    
    Hare Krsna. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. Does anybody have any question?
    
    
    
    
    Q: Prabhupada brought Vedic culture to West. But in West, the lifestyle is different. How to adjust to that and how can men relate to women?
    
    A: Prabhupada didn’t bring Indian or Oriental culture to West, but he brought spiritual Culture to the whole world. Anyone who wants to make his life successful can take advantage of that. If we think that it is Indian culture and meant for Westerners it would be a mistake. It is meant for everyone. Everybody is a spirit soul. Only the body is West. So, in order to remain situated in transcendental platform one has to rise above this bodily conception. Regarding relation, one has to develop a love for Krsna. When that happens, the bodily lust will disappear. This doesn’t mean that one doesn’t have a relation with a woman. But he sees them with a reverential attitude. In ISKCON there are gruhastas. When both husband and wife both become devotees, they help each other in their spirituality. Naturally they overcome the difficulties imposed by material nature.
    
    
    
    
    Q: Is it possible to develop the qualities of Krsna?
    
    A: Yes. When one become purified and is situated in one’s consciousness, one develops roughly around 50 qualities of the 64 qualities of Krsna.
    
    
    
    
    Q: How can Shantanu King give boon?
    
    A: Yes. Sometimes even great personalities can give boon. He only gave a boon that he would die whenever he wishes to. After all who would like to live in material world forever?

    TRANSLATION
    
    Lord Rsabhadeva told His sons: My dear boys, of all the living
    
    entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has
    
    been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply
    
    for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool. One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service. By such activity, one's heart is purified, and when one attains this position, he attains eternal,blissful life, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.
    
    
    
    
    PURPORT
    
    In this verse, Lord Rsabhadeva tells His sons about the importance of
    
    Human life. The word deha-bhak refers to anyone who accepts a material
    
    body, but the living entity who is awarded the human form must act
    
    differently from animals. Animals like dogs and hogs enjoy sense
    
    gratification by eating stool. After undergoing severe hardships all day,
    
    human beings are trying to enjoy themselves at night by eating, drinking,
    
    having sex and sleeping. At the same time, they have to properly defend
    
    themselves. However, this is not human civilization. Human life means
    
    voluntarily practicing suffering for the advancement of spiritual life.
    
    There is, of course, suffering in the lives of animals and plants, which
    
    are suffering due to their past misdeeds. However, human beings should
    
    voluntarily accept suffering in the form of austerities and penances in
    
    order to attain the divine life. After attaining the divine life, one can
    
    enjoy happiness eternally. After all, every living entity is trying to
    
    enjoy happiness, but as long as one is encaged in the material body. He
    
    has to suffer different kinds of misery. A higher sense is present in the
    
    human form. We should act according to superior advice in order to attain
    
    eternal happiness and go back to Godhead.
    
    It is significant in this verse that the government and the natural
    
    guardian, the father, should educate subordinates and raise them to Krsna
    
    consciousness. Devoid of Krsna consciousness, every living being suffers
    
    in this cycle of birth and death perpetually. To relieve them from this
    
    bondage and enable them to become blissful and happy, bhakti-yoga should
    
    be taught. A foolish civilization neglects to teach people how to rise to
    
    the platform of bhakti-yoga. Without Krsna consciousness, a person is no
    
    better than a hog or dog. The instructions of Rsabhadeva are very
    
    essential at the present moment. People are being educated and trained to
    
    work very hard for sense gratification. and there is no sublime aim in
    
    life. A man travels to earn his livelihood, leaving home early in the
    
    morning, catching a local train and being packed in a compartment. He has
    
    to stand for an hour or two in order to reach his place of business. Then,
    
    again he takes a bus to get to the office. At the office he works hard
    
    from nine to five; then he takes two or three hours to return home. After
    
    eating, he has sex and goes to sleep. For all this hardship, his only
    
    happiness is a little sex. “Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham” -
    
    Rsabhadeva clearly states that human life is not meant for this kind of
    
    existence, which is enjoyed even by dogs and hogs. Indeed, dogs and hogs
    
    do not have to work so hard for sex. A human being should try to live in
    
    a different way and should not try to imitate dogs and hogs. The
    
    alternative is mentioned. Human life is meant for tapasya, austerity and
    
    penance. By tapasya, one can get out of the material clutches. When one
    
    is situated in Krsna consciousness, devotional service, his happiness is
    
    guaranteed eternally. By taking to bhakti-yoga, devotional service, one's
    
    existence is purified. The living entity is seeking happiness life after
    
    life, but he can make a solution to all his problems simply by practicing
    
    bhakti-yoga. Then, he immediately becomes eligible to return home, back to
    
    Godhead. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):
    
    janma karma ca me divyam
    
    evam yo vetti tattvatah
    
    tyaktva deham punar janma
    
    naiti mam eti so 'rjuna
    
    "One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and
    
    activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this
    
    material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
    
    
    
    
    Rishabadev was the King of Earth Planet. He was giving parting advice to his sons as he was just about to leave to take-up the renounced order of life. He practically walked with nothing leaving everything behind. This is the foundation of Vedic culture namely, renunciation and detachment. Here we see that he was a King and one fine day he was ready to walkout. But before leaving, he is giving final advice to his sons. He had 100 sons, eldest being Bharat Maharaj, anointed as the successor to the throne. And nine of them became yogendras.
    
    
    
    
    Rishabadev is advising his sons to abstain from sense gratification especially, after having assumed a human form of body. Instead, one should use it for spiritual endeavor as the sense gratification is even possible in animal form. In the above verse, the term “vit-bhujan” refers to stool-eaters. One such animal is pig which madly runs after woman pigs. Rather, one should design his life to perform austerities i.e., to voluntary accept difficulties for spiritual advancement. Rishabadev is a perfect example of Brahmachari. He accepted the renounced order of life to stay fixed up on the lotus feet of Krsna. As we already discussed, Brahmacharya means not just being a celibate. Devotees want to be lovers of Krsna rather than just being celibate.

    TRANSLATION
    
    When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he
    
    certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds
    
    of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has
    
    already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his
    
    misery. Actually the living entity should not have taken on a material
    
    body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification.
    
    Therefore, I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself
    
    again in the activities of sense gratification by which he perpetually
    
    gets material bodies one after another.
    
    
    
    
    Material nature is world of illusion, where a spirit-soul is entrapped in it. The prime illusion is to consider the body to be the self. As a result, the male body becomes attracted to the female body and vice- versa, thus deepening the illusion. This point is explained in verse 8.

    The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of
    
    material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties
    
    together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his
    
    body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth. In this way one
    
    increases life's illusions and thinks in terms of "I and mine."
    
    
    
    
    The spirit-soul is entrapped in this material world due to the basic attraction for the opposite sex where all the trouble begins. Srila Prabhupada often pointed out that we are not this body but spirit-souls. The moment we misidentify ourselves to be the body, the attraction begins. That’s why we have to uphold this spiritual culture given by Srila Prabhupada and distribute it to others. We are not really performing our duty unless we distribute this spiritual culture. In Bhagavatam, it is repeatedly mentioned to not to get attached to this body.  The purpose of this seminar is also the same. I personally felt that there is a need for an in depth understanding of this responsibility. Since, we are already present on this material platform, the least we can do is to come out of it to be situated in spiritual platform. Brahmacharya is to become situated in spiritual platform. In earlier days, there was some misconception about Brahmacharya which meant to hate women. Those false conceptions don’t work out. In fact, the people who hated women were the first one to fall down. One must learn to respect women. 
    
    
    
    
    Srila Prabhupada taught that in Krsna consciousness, even householders can be Brahmacharyis. Those who unite just for the sake of procreation are also Brahmacharis. This process of copulation is a very painful experience. But just to trick human beings, nature awards some pleasure in it. The modern society has forgotten this real purpose and indulges in it for flickering pleasure. Consequently, they destroy themselves. Therefore a spiritual person should consider this sex-life as the most painful process. 
    
    The people who come to spiritual platform are the real ones who can benefit this human society.  Those whose life is centered on sex-life are in illusion. They cannot benefit others when they themselves are under false conception. A blind man will only take another blind man to a gutter. Hence in order to properly guide the human society, there is a need for people with proper spiritual vision. Srila Prabhupada came to distribute this spiritual culture. One has to take Prabhupada’s teachings to his heart so as to understand His mission and become engaged in His service.  Brahmacharya or spiritual reality is the foundation of it. Hence, Brahmacharya is the very basis of spiritual life. 
    
    Recently, I was reading an article about the Olympics held in Australia wherein the trainers prohibit their students from indulging in sex-life. Thus, even materialistic people are severing this sex-life for material gain. But the society leaders are misleading the human society and making it a pig-society. The Western-culture is based on four activities namely, meat-eating, gambling, intoxication and illicit sex. Next to industries, only these are the activities that are being promoted everywhere. A common man can easily become rich if he runs a meat-industry or invests in drug-trafficking. The government is also promoting these businesses. This is the sad state of affairs today.  
    
    Kali is spreading through these activities which ought to be defeated. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came to defeat Kali and spread Krsna consciousness. Being the followers of ISKCON, we ourselves have to follow these four regulative principles to hold back the Kali’s influence and spread Krsna consciousness all over the world. In that case, we can proclaim the victory of Mahaprabhu’s mission. When that happens, people who still have the inclination to indulge in sinful activities will be sent to the forest. In order to accomplish this objective of ISKCON, we have to become qualified soldiers of Mahaprabhu’s army. 
    
    Thank you very much. All glories to Srila Prabhupada. Does anybody have any question?
    
    Q: why do people don’t go to forest for their renounced order of life nowadays?
    
    A: In age of Kali, devotees don’t go to forest. They prefer to stay in big cities and do Hari-Naam sankirtan. For us, the forest is Vrindavan and Mayapur. The way the saintly people lived was also exemplary. They live in forest but not like animals. They create a beautiful atmosphere by residing on the banks of a river and planting trees. A very beautiful description is given in Ramayana.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>Hare Krishna! So did everybody get the summary of the first six chapters? So today I will cover all the six chapters in one go. Are you all ready for that? With rapt attention? What is Bhagavad-Gita? Bhagavad-Gita is the essence of the Vedas. The Vedas are vast, therefore Vyasadeva considered, or Krishna actually considered, that the essence of the Vedas should be given, presented for the conditioned souls, for the fallen degraded souls of the age of Kali. And that’s why He presented that in the Mahabharata, in the form of advising Arjuna. At a very critical time when the battle of Kurukshetra was about to begin, at that time Arjuna decided not to fight. He dropped his bow and arrows and he told Krishna, ‘Krishna I cannot fight in that way.’ And at that time Krishna started to advise Arjuna. And that advice that Krishna gave is the Bhagavad-Gita. 

    Why Krishna wanted Arjuna to fight? There are two reasons. One is, this battle was Krishna’s arrangement. You remember that verse, yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata? (4.7) Then what does Krishna do? Paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam.(4.8) Krishna protects the sadhus, Krishna protects the devotees and he annihilates the demons. Therefore Krishna made that arrangement. During His Vrindavana pastimes He killed all the demons, then He left Vrindavana and went to Mathura and killed Kamsa. And then He killed many, many demons one after another. Then He made many other demons to be killed by His devotees like Bhima and Arjuna. And then finally that battle was arranged where all the demons put in one side and all devotees on the other side. And He caused a mass annihilation in order to re-establish dharma. Now, all this battle was arranged and now Arjuna said that he is not going to fight. That is why Krishna wanted to provoke Arjuna. 
    
    Another reason is, that all the endeavours were made by so many devotees to stop the battle. So many learned, wise individuals advised them. Vyasadeva personally came to advise Duryodhana. Bhisma told, Vidura told, Gandhari told – but Duryodhana was adamant. Finally Krishna Himself went as a messenger with a peace proposal. But Duryodhana what to speak of listening to Him, he decided to arrest Krishna. He thought if Krishna is not there with the Pandavas, then the Pandavas will become absolutely week and to win over them will be easy for us. So he thought that he will arrest Krishna. At that time Krishna showed His universal form. 
    
    All the efforts had already been made, and Duryodhana was adamant, completely adamant to fight the battle. And now when the battle is all set, after all these efforts of peace proposals, then Arjuna said that he will not fight. So Krishna started to advice Arjuna about Bhagavad-Gita. And the apparent objective of Bhagavad-Gita was to provoke Arjuna into the battle. But the ulterior purpose of Bhagavad-gita is to give it to us, so that we can receive that knowledge. That has been very wonderfully described in the Gita-mahatmya. ‘Sarvopanishado gavo dogdha Gopalanandanaha, vatsaha partho sudhirbhokta dugdham Gitamritam mahat. Sarvopanishado gavo. All the Upanishads are like a cow and Krishna is the cowherd boy who milks the cow, making Arjuna the object of that milking. The cow gives milk for the sake of the calf. Because of the calf the cow gives the milk. But the calf doesn’t drink all the milk. Who drinks the milk? Human beings drink milk. So here Arjuna is the nimitte. Arjuna is the objective through whom the Gita was presented. But who drinks this Bhagavad-gita? This nectar of Bhagavad- Gita? Su-dhih. Those, who have very advanced intelligence. Those, who have very beautiful intelligence,. This word ‘su’ can indicates ‘sundara’ which is beautiful intelligence; another is advanced intelligence. People with advanced intelligence can relish Bhagavad-Gita. So that is the purpose of Bhagavad-Gita and in this way, Krishna actually derives the essence of the Vedas. The Vedas have two branches: one branch is Upanishads and the other branch is Puranas. So the essence of Upanishads is Bhagavad-gita and the essence of all the Puranas is the Srimad Bhagavatam. That is why these two scriptures are absolutely essential. If anybody wants to understand the wisdom of the Vedas, the teachings of the Vedas, then these are the two scriptures that are absolutely essential. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu established these teachings through Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam. All our Acaryas have done that and finally Srila Prabhupada also established the Krishna Consciousness movement on the basis of these two scriptures. You see the importance of these two scriptures. In the morning we study Srimad Bhagavatam and in the evening we study Bhagavad-Gita. So in this way Srila Prabhupada established the importance of these two scriptures. Bhagavad-Gita is very, very important. Bhagavad-Gita is a preliminary study. You begin your spiritual study with Bhagavad-gita. And then the advanced course is Srimad-Bhagavatam. And the post graduate course is Caitanya-Caritamrita. 
    
    In the first chapter it has been described how Arjuna decided not to fight but Krishna insisted that he must. He convinced him. Arjuna is actually telling Krishna that he is not going to fight. Then, from the second chapter onwards Krishna’s instructions begin. So Krishna lets Arjuna speak. …
    
    Second chapter of Bhagavad-Gita is known as Sankhya-yoga. But Srila Prabhupada actually titled it as ‘the summary of the Bhagavad-Gita summarized’. The second chapter gives the summary of the Bhagavad-Gita. Now, Sankhya is the analytical study, you analyse. We see that’s what Krishna is doing. Krishna is telling Arjuna the difference between the body and the soul. Arjuna gives various reasons why he won’t be able to fight this battle. Why he should not fight this battle. And it is a very difficult battle to fight as it is. Battle is a serious business. When a warrior, when a ksatriya goes into a battlefield he goes there only with two options open to him – either he will win the battle or he will die. He goes to the battlefield of course with an intention to win but at the same time he knows and his family members know, when somebody goes into a battle the chances of his not coming back is also there. The ksatriya accordingly it seems so they are enjoying so much, they are having a living a royal life, and so much enjoyment and so much fun, but actually the ksatriyas lives are very, very critical and crucial. Can you imagine, the young man goes to the battlefield, and not only the king but all his soldiers and many of them die. And sometimes the king himself dies. And all of a sudden the whole family lost everything. They lost their kingdom because they have been defeated by their enemy. It is actually very painful. That is what has been pointed out in Bhagavad-gita. What does the mode of passion lead to? Mode of passion actually leads to suffering. The effort is there, the endeavour is there to enjoy but eventually it ends up in suffering. Mode of passion leads to suffering. It is only in the mode of goodness that one can be situated in happiness. The real happiness is in the mode of goodness. And the spiritual bliss is even beyond the mode of goodness, in the mode of pure goodness, visuddha tattva. Therefore an intelligent person becomes situated in the mode of goodness and transcends the mode of goodness and comes to the spiritual goodness or pure goodness. 
    
    Arjuna is there in the battlefield and he says that he can not kill his guru, his grandfather. He is saying. He is telling Krishna, ‘how can I kill my grandfather? How could I shot arrows – katham bhismam aham sankye dronam ca madhusudana isubhih pratiyotsyami (2.4), isubhih means with arrows, pratiyosyami with contest. Not only that I will shot arrows at them, they will also shot arrows at me. It’s a very difficult situation. So he said, I’m not going to fight this battle. And Krishna heard, Krishna heard, Krishna heard silently. Then finally when Arjuna says, ‘Krishna, I do not know what to do. I am completely confused. Now You please tell me what I should do. I’m assuming the role of Your disciple. I’m becoming Your disciple which means I am accepting You as my spiritual master.’ So when Arjuna submitted himself to Krishna then only Krishna started to advise him. So here also we learn one lesson, unless and until we surrender to Krishna, Krishna is not going to take our responsibility. Sometimes people say, why Krishna is doing this to me, why Krishna is not doing that to me? But the point is, are you surrendering yourself to Krishna? If you are surrendering yourself to Krishna, Krishna will take your responsibility. There is no doubt about that. Krishna Himself is giving that assure. So you surrender and Krishna will take control. 
    
    When Arjuna surrendered himself to Krishna, and accepted Him as his spiritual master, then Krishna started to advise him. And those advices are so wonderful. And that is what constitutes Bhagavad-Gita. When Krishna started to speak, the first thing Krishna told Arjuna, ‘Arjuna, you are speaking like a wise man but you don’t know anything. Asocyan anvasocas tvam – you are lamenting over things that one should not lament for. And yet prajna-vadams ca bhasase – you are speaking like a wise man. So He just smashed him straight away. And then He started to give him the advice. ‘Arjuna, you are lamenting that you will kill your grandfather, you will kill these kings and your friends and relatives, but there was never a time when they were not here and there will never be a time when they will not be here. There was never a time when you, I, all these kings were not here and there will never be a time when they will not be here.’ Now, who is that, that will always be here? Who has been in the past, has presented at the moment and will continue to be there in the future? Who is that? The soul. And then Krishna made that point also very clear. The difference between the body and the soul. That is why Bhagavad-Gita is actually very scientific. Bhagavad-Gita is a science. It is the science of the spiritual reality. We have different sciences, sciences of physics, science of chemistry, science of mathematics. There are so many different sciences. Those are the sciences of material subject matters. But this is the science of the spiritual reality. The science of the soul. The science of the soul will lead to the spiritual nature. And eventually it will lead to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore study this subject properly. Then Krishna actually makes this point in very simple way. It is so simple, yet so profound. Just see, the body and the soul. Krishna is establishing the two different elements. He is saying that the body changes from childhood to boyhood to youth, to old age. The body changes but the person doesn’t change. So in spite of the change of the body you are not changing. None of us is changing. Our body is changing but we are the same persons. I at a five year old, I at the age of fifteen, I at the age of twenty-five and I at the age of sixty- four. I am the same person although my body changed. And so Krishna is making a conclusion, that in spite of the changing of the body the person does not change. So when the body will not be there, still the person will be there. In this way He is establishing the eternity of the soul. Dehino ‘smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara tatha dehantara- praptir. (2.13) Tatha – just as the body changes. But in spite of the change of the body the person doesn’t change. So when the person will leave the body he will take up another body. Dehantara-praptir. And dhiras tatra na muhyatia, a person situated in knowlage doesn’t lament over that change of the body. And then He establishes the characteristics of the soul. Na jayate mriyate va kadacin. (2.20) The soul is never born nor the will ever die. The soul cannot be destroyed by anything. The body can be killed but soul cannot be killed. The body can be killed by weapons, the body can be killed by fire, the body can be drowned in water. In this way, the can be killed in so many ways. Nainam chindanti sastrani nainam dahati pavakah. (2.23) The soul cannot be cut by any weapon, the soul cannot be burned by fire, the soul cannot be drowned in water, the soul cannot be dried by air. Avinasi tu tad viddhi yena sarvam idam tatam. (2.17) So therefore you recognize that the soul is indestructible. The soul is eternal, first He established, then He established that the soul is indestructible. And in this way, Krishna dealt with the initial aspect of the differentiating the soul from the body. Unfortunately in the material nature we identified ourselves with the body. And that is the cause of our suffering, the cause of our distress. Because we are identified ourselves with the body we are so frustrated. Frustrated why? Because we are actually hankering for the, our hankerings are spiritual. Our hankerings are from the soul. We are conscious beings, we are desiring. There is another consideration. The characteristic of the soul is consciousness. The characteristic of the soul is to desire. And when the desire is fulfilled, there is happiness. Now the problem is that our desires are spiritual and we are trying to achieve those desires, fulfil those desires through this material body. So that is why our desires are never fulfilled. And we are always ending up in disappointment and frustration. And that is the cause of our suffering. The soul is eternal, we don’t want to die. Because we are eternal by nature. We want to be eternal. But we are trying to attain that immortality or eternity through the body. We are trying to make this body eternal, which will never happen. We are trying to make this body fully conscious, which will never happen. And we are trying to experience joy through this body, which will never happen. That is why our life is a series of disappointments and frustrations. So in this way, Krishna is actually preparing us to the right form of understanding. So eventually Krishna comes to the point, what is the characteristic of a wise man. Arjuna is asking, what is the characteristic of a wise man. Stitha prajna, a person who is situated in perfect knowledge. And Krishna describes the nature of a stitha prajna. And here, since we are discussing about sankhya-philosophy we can go to the sankhya-branch of philosophy. Briefly I discuss about that. Sankhya is the analytical study. The purpose of this analytical study is to analyze the material nature and eventually come to the spiritual understanding. Now, the sankhya-philosophy is doing that. Sankhya-philosophy basically is dealing with first analyzing the material elements. There are five elements. Earth, fire, water, air, ether. Then there are five senses. We have five senses, eyes, ears, nose, tongue and tough. Now our senses interact with the five elements. And as a result of that five objects of the senses are generated. Like eyes interact with fire – form is produced. Ear interact with ether – sound is produced. Air interacts with skin – touch is produced. Water interacts with tongue – taste is produced. Nose interacts with earth – smell is produced. So in this way five objects of the senses are produced. So how many got three fives are? Fifteen. Then there are five working senses. Hands, legs, anus, belly and genitals. So, twenty. Then there are three subtle elements, mind, intelligence and false ego. And then there is a sound total of material elements – mahat-tattva. Twenty-four. In this twenty-four considerations the entire material nature has been analyzed. Now see, how thoughtful, how profound, how penetrating they are. They consider that all these twenty-four considerations are objective nature. But the object cannot exist without the subject. So who is the subject? The subject is ‘I’. Now, the entire material nature has been analyzed with these twenty-four considerations. ‘I’ couldn’t be found there. Therefore, ‘I’ is beyond material. So in this way, sankhya is transcending the material platform and coming to the spiritual platform. The ‘I’ is non material, therefore the ‘I’ is spiritual. Then also they didn’t stop at that. The ‘I’s’ are many and minute. So anything that is many and minute must have an origin, master resource. So the ‘I’ ist the twenty-fifth consideration. And the Supreme Personality of Godhead, from whom all the ‘I’s’ have come or all the souls have come, is the twenty- sixth consideration. So that is the general sankhya-philosophy. But Krishna is making an analysis in a rather different way. In a more simple way. Just in two verses. Bhumir apo ‘nalo vayuh kham mano buddhir eva ca. (7.4) Bhumi, earth, water, fire, air and ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. Krishna then is pointing out this material nature has been comprised of this eight material elements. Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. But then He is considering that apareyam itas tv anyam (7.5) this is inferior by nature. But beyond this inferior material nature there is a superior nature of mine and the jiva-bhutam, the spirit souls are coming from the superior nature and they are sustaining this material nature. Isn’t it the same conclusion? But Krishna’s conclusion is so simple. Why? Because Krishna is not beating around the bush. He is going straight to the point. Why? Because He knows. When we do not know, then we make an extensive search. And then, through that we come to the conclusion. But when somebody knows he can present it in a very simple way. Therefore the wise mans presentation is very simple and a fools presentation is elaborate. So Krishna is just pointing it out in a very simple way. Bhinna prakrtir astadha and then apareyam itas tv anyam prakrtim viddhi me param. Beyond this inferior material nature there is a superior nature. Now the consideration is, whether we are going to be life in the world of Krishna. Krishna is saying, Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What is the use, what is the need for Krishna to lie? What is the use of Krishna to say something which is not true? That’s why an intelligent person will accept the words of Krishna without any doubts or hesitations. And that is what Krishna’s representative always try to remind us. Accept the words of Krishna. That is what Srila Prabhupada came and told us time and time again. Just accept the words of Krishna. Then everything becomes crystal clear, everything becomes easy and our lives become full of joy. All we have to do is simply accept it. 
    
    In the third chapter Krishna is actually presenting the arrangement of this material nature. This material nature has different demigods controlling the different affairs of this material nature. Who are the demigods? They are very powerful individuals. They are empowered by Krishna to take care of different affairs of the material nature. An example can be given. Just as in the governmental affairs there different departments. There are different individuals who are in charge. Responsible part those departments. Like we have electric supply department, water supply department, education department, finance department, public works department, construction department, road department, atomic research department and on top there is a person who is in charge of those departments. And what are those departments doing? Those departments actually provide us with different facilities. They provide us with facilities. Like we are sitting in a room we are getting electric supply. And as a result of that what we have to do? We are getting the electricity, enjoying the facility but we have to pay the bills. We have to pay for the facilities that we are enjoying. Now the demigods are the departmental heads. And Krishna is telling that they are going to supply you with all those necessities of your life and you pay them in return. And that is the system of sacrifice, yajna. … This arrangement has been made, the arrangement of yajna. Which means simply, you enjoy the facility and pay the bill. And if you do that, then what will happen? You will enjoy. You lead a very, very nice and happy life. But if you don’t pay then, what will happen? You enjoy the electricity, for one month you have enjoyed it, and then the bill came and you decided not to pay the bill. What will happen? The next month there won’t be any electricity. They cut it off. They cut the electric supply. So similarly in a broader sense, in the nature, we are getting all this facilities but there we were being provided by the demigods. And we are supposed to offer them the sacrifice. We are supposed to pay the bill in the form of sacrifice. They don’t want anything else. All they want is just some sacrifice. It costs very little. You are getting so much and you are paying so little. So why not? So why Krishna is advising us to do that? Because this is how the law and order of this material nature will be maintained. It’s like a large and extensive government system, affairs of the material nature. And Krishna advices that in this way how one can life so happily. And eventually Krishna is actually saying that what is your need? An example has been given. You need food. That is the most essential element, ingredient for our survival. And the food is produced because of rain. Annad bhavanti bhutani.(3.14) Living entities survive by eating food. Parjanyad anna-sambhava. The food grains were produced due to rain. And yajnad bhavati parjano. And it is because of yajna, sacrifice that rain actually comes. Yajnah karma-samudbhavah. In this way the process of sacrifice has been established by Krishna. And in this way Krishna gave an extensive understanding of how to live happily in this nature. The supplier and consumer, a proper relationship must be established. And this relationship comes on ultimately in the form of the kings. Who will train the people? Who will make all this arrangements? The leader of the mankind. The kings. Unfortunately in democracy there is no king. And therefore all kinds of low class people are taking up the leadership. But actually the kings are the highest class of people. They are rajarsis, the saintly personalities who used to become the king. And they used to be trained up from their childhood to execute this job properly. They used to properly trained and then they used to assume the responsibility. But in the name of democracy what is happening? People, those who don’t have any training, all they know is how to bluff, how to swindle, how to cheat and get votes. And when they get votes, then they become the leader. And that also only for five or four years. And they know, that whatever they have to make they have to make it in these four years time. And as a result of that, the human society is in such a terrible condition. But Krishna actually pointed out that this knowledge, this system was established by the royal order. 
    
    In the beginning of the forth chapter Krishna is telling, that I give this knowledge to the sungod, Vivasvan, imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam vivasvan manave praha.(4.1) Vivasvan gave it to Manu, sungod gave it to his son, Vaivasvata Manu. And Manu gave it to his son Iksvaku. And evam parampara-praptam imam rajarsayo vidhu.(4.2) In the line of saintly kings, in the disciplic succession of the saintly kings this knowledge was flowing and they were actually establishing this understanding and guiding their citizens in the proper path of prosperity and happiness. So that was Krishna’s point. He just gradually mentioned it. But then Arjuna came on with a question. Arjuna said, ‘Vivasvan was born so long ago, and you were born just the other day, aparam bhavato janma param janma vivasvatah, katham etad vijaniyam tvam adau proktavan iti. (4.4) How can I believe, not believe, he said vijaniyam, how can I understand that you gave this knowledge to Vivasvan? See, all this while in the Bhagavad-Gita and before also, Arjuna and Krishna they were cousins. Their relationships were that of cousins. And Arjuna and Krishna were of the same age. Therefore they had a very intimate, friendly relationship. Just as among the cousins of the same age become close to each other, very intimate to each other. So that was Arjuna’s relationship with Krishna. He was His cousin. But now his cousin was saying ‘I gave this knowledge to Vivasvan’? So now automatically he was curious. How can He speak like that? Then Krishna actually makes the point. Look Arjuna, bhahuni me vyatitani janma tava carjuna.(4.5) Many, many times, both you and I have taken birth. Tany aham veda sarvani. But I know all of them. Na tvam vettah parantapa. But Arjuna, you do not remember them. So in this way Krishna is now establishing the difference between Him and Arjuna. The difference between the living entity and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The living entity is also eternal, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is also eternal. But the difference is, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead knows everything whereas the living entity forgets. As soon as he dies he forgets. Then he begins with a new body and in that body he begins another chapter. Then, in this way, life after life, in different bodies, he goes through different experiences. And he forgets about his previous life. Whereas Krishna is telling, that tany aham veda sarvani, sarvani means all. Of those lives, I have been, I remember everything. Then Krishna is saying, ‘Actually, Arjuna, I don’t have to take birth. You need o take birth. You have to go from one body to another, through the cycle of birth and death. But that is not the case with me. Ajo ‘pi sann avyayatma bhutanam isvaro ‘pi san, prakrtim svam adhistaya sambhavamy atma- mayaya.(4.6) Sambhavamy atma-mayaya, I manifest, I appear, I am actually unborn. In order to come here I don’t have to take birth. Sometimes I take birth. Especially when I perform my pastime as a human being, in the human life form. Then I take birth, like Ramacandra, Krishnacandra, Caitanyacandra, I take birth. But there are many other incarnations where I don’t take birth, where I don’t need to take birth. Like Matsya, Kurma. Matsya-avatara didn’t take birth from another fish. He just appeared to king Satyavrata. As Varahadev He appeared from the nostril of Brahma. As Kurma He just appeared from nowhere. There was a need. Now the milk-ocean has to be churned, they got Mandara Mountain to churn the milk-ocean. But when the brought the Mandara Mountain it sank in the milk-ocean. So both, the demigods and the demons, were completely baffled. Now, what to do? So Krishna said, don’t worry. I will take care of it. So He appeared as tortoise and He supported that mountain on His back. So in this way, Krishna can appear in any way. He can appear from nowhere, He can also appear from somewhere, He can also appear from a pillar, as Nrsimhadeva did. So that is why how wonderful Krishna’s activities are. So, ajo api, although I am unborn but still bhutanam isvaro ‘pi san, prakrtim svam adhisthaya, taking shelter of my eternal potency I manifest Myself. Sambhavamy atma-mayaya. And why do I come? Yada yada hi dharmasy glanir bhavati bharata.(4.7) So in this way, Krishna is now establishing His real identity as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the fourth chapter Krishnas identity has been established as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And then Krishna advised Arjuna how and why to surrender unto Him. 
    
    And then in the fifth chapter Krishna actually goes into another aspect of sacrifice. Prior to that in the third chapter, Krishna spoke about yajna or sacrifice. And He said that, offer it to the demigods. But then He pointed out that the demigods are actually granting you all this facilities because of Me. I have given them the authority. It is My arrangement. Therefore, there is no need to go to the demigods. You can come directly to Me. So in this way in the fifth chapter, Krishna very eloquently reminded us that the real sacrifice is to offer everything to Krishna. That is the ultimate purpose of our sacrifice. 
    
    Thank you very much. 
    
    Question : The living entity is superior energy. So how come this superior energy is weaker than the inferior energy? 
    
    Guru Maharaja : Very good point. The living entities are from the superior energy and material nature is inferior. Then how come the superior energy, the living entities come under the control of the material nature? The living entities are not superior energy as such. They are from the superior energy. But they are minute. Whereas material nature although it is inferior by nature or characteristic, it is Krishnas own potency. Daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya. (7.14) Living entities therefore had been classified as marginal. There are two energies: inferior energy and superior energy. External energy, internal energy. And in between there is the marginal energy, the living entities. The living entities are from the marginal energy. Marginal means, they have the option open to them. Whether they want to go to the inferior energy or whether they want to go to the superior energy. If they surrender to Krishna then they will be in the superior nature. If they reject Krishna, then they will be in the inferior nature. The simple option is open to them. 
    
    Question : One technical question? 
    
    Guru Maharaja : Sure. 
    
    [Question unclear] 
    
    Guru Maharaja : This disciplic succession, Krishna is saying, that I am reestablishing the knowledge, because it is lost, through you. Because you are my friend and you are my devotee. And the disciplic succession that is been given there is a Gaudiya vaisnava line. Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya line. In that line Arjuna also is not there. Right? So that it a very special line. And that line is not exactly that line of Bhagavad-gita. That is the Bhagavata-parampara, the line of Srimad Bhagavatam. The understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You see, that is why the Bhagavad-gita is the primary study, it is not leading you. I mean, it is not taking you to the ultimate point. It is leading you towards that direction. But Srimad Bhagavatam is what will lead you to the main point. 
    
    Question : In the second chapter it is said, the second chapter is known as Gita-sutre. Because in this separate karma and jnana has been described clearly but not Bhakti. So how can I understand that point? 
    
    Guru Maharaja : Initially, Krishna is taking us step by step into that point. Karma and jnana have been discussed but Bhakti is a very special line. Indication has been given. Say for example, when Krishna is saying, that I am reestablishing all this through you, because bhakto ‘si me sakha ceti, (7.3), indication of that is there, but the elaborate and extensive discussion didn’t take place. Krishna is reserving it from seventh to twelfth chapter. The first six chapters of Bhagavad-gita are dealing with karma, the second six chapters are dealing with Bhakti and the third six chapters are dealing with jnana. Now, one may say, that means karma and then Bhakti and then ultimately jnana? No, that is not the real understanding. The real understanding is, when you have something very valuable, where do you keep it? Do you keep it outside or keep it in the middle? You protect it. So that is what Krishna did. The second six chapters, the midst six chapter, are the most important part of Bhagavad-gita. And we will discuss that. 
    
    [Question unclear] 
    
    Guru Maharaja : You see, although Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He gave the knowledge, but we cannot really converse with Krishna. Like knowledge is based on question and answers. When you don’t understand, what do you do? You have to ask. You have to present :”Well, can you please explain this or what I cannot understand?” Now, we can’t do that with Krishna. Therefore Krishna’s representatives are there who we can ask and who can explain it to us. And that representative of Krishna is the spiritual master. So, we need a spiritual master to ask questions to who can dispel our doubts. But his qualification is that he simply repeats what Krishna has said. He doesn’t concoct something new. And that is why he is a bona fide representative of Krishna. Like for example, you can take a book. But can you master the subject just by reading the book yourself? It is practically impossible. For example if you want to become a doctor. There are so many books on that science. But just by studying those books, can you become a doctor? No. but you go to the faculty university, medical science, and you study under the guidance of the teachers. And, after three, four or five years, you become a qualified doctor. Because you understood the subject. What is present in the books, has been simplified by this people, the teachers. And that is how you have mastered the subject. Similarly the spiritual knowledge also must be received through the guidance of a bona fide teacher. And those bona fide teachers are the spiritual masters. And their qualification is, that they represent Krishna. They present the way, the knowledge has been given by Krishna. And they have received to knowledge as it has been presented by Krishna, because they have received it from a person who had mastered the subject himself.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>From today, I thought of conducting the seminar in a special way. I thought, for say about half an hour I will discuss the 7th chapter and then I will divide you all into different groups and then I will speak to all, to discuss among yourselves and bring out the essence of the 7th chapter from that discussion. Do you like the idea? 

    As I mentioned yesterday, from 7th chapter begins the bhakti essence. The first 6 chapters gradually lead to the bhakti. And how many of you remember the last verse of the previous chapter? How many of you? I ask you to raise your hands, no, just start reciting. So what is the verse? O dattatreya’. What’s the meaning of it? 
    
    So what is the purpose of yoga? The purpose of yoga is to become united with Krsna and what is the best way to become united with Krsna. Through love and that love is bhakti. Bhakti is pure and in simple words means love and when that love is for Krsna, it is called bhakti and when that love is expressed through certain love and its expression. It is not just I love you and you love me. It is not that just some empty words. There must be some substance. Ok, you love me what are you going to do about it? You say that you love me and would you give me your bank account? Sometimes Prabhupada used to say that some people used to come from Calcutta to Mayapur, they used to come and they wanted to surrender. And Prabhupada’s question used to be, “What would you be doing with your money?”“Oh, I gave my money to my children”. “So, you gave your money to your children and you have come here to become a burden. That’s not fair!” If you really want to surrender, surrender with wherever your heart is not just some empty false or fake surrender. Because, one thing, we must remember, we can’t cheat Krsna or we can’t fool Krsna. He’s sitting right in the heart. And he knows us better than we do. He knows more than us, what’s going on inside of us. With that understanding we must approach Krsna and that is the actual meaning of the “Krishna’s stealing the garments of the gopis”. Krsna stole the garments of the gopis. The way, they are approaching Krsna, we should be completely naked, nothing to hide and that is the surrender, so that is the meaning of bhakti. 
    
    So the 7th chapter is beginning with: 
    
    sri bhagavan uvaca mayy asakta manah partha yogam yunjan mad asrayah asamsayam samagram mam yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu 
    
    “The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Now hear o son of Prtha, how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.” (BG 7.1) 
    
    So, what is the simple meaning of this verse? Your mind fully attached to me. What does it mean? When does the mind become fully attached to somebody? When, we have love for that person. It is due to our love that our mind becomes attracted to him and naturally completely attached to him, obsessed with him. 
    
    So, what is the best way of knowing Krsna? By developing love for Krsna. When we develop love for Krsna then our heart will be completely absorbed in his thoughts. When we fall in love with Krsna, then, whatever we do, we simply would want to do it more. That is, what love means and then only will we get to know Krsna. What does it mean, “we’ll get to know Krsna?”
    
    Krsna will reveal Himself to us. What is the best way to know someone? When the person comes and stands in front of us, then you get to know him. Getting to know Krsna means Krsna will come and reveal himself to us. And, that will happen only, when we develop our love for Him. Krsna is assuring Arjuna now. So the word bakshami means, I will tell you 
    
    jnanam to ham sa vijnanam idam vaksyamy asesatah yaj jnatva neha bhuyo nyaj jnatavyam avasisyate (BG 7.2) 
    
    So vaksyamy, the word vaksyamy means I will tell you. The word asesatah means in full, in complete. Asesatah endless, in complete and this is vijnanam. Vijnanam means knowledge and realized knowledge. Intellectual perception of, intellectually knowing something is jnanam and realising something means vijanam. So, Krsna is not talking about jnanam. He is talking about sa vijnanam. I will tell you about the realisation about myself and when you get to know that, nothing will be left to know. So that is the meaning of Krsna consciousness. 
    
    So Krsna is assuring Arjuna, reassuring, but then Krsna is pointing out, manusyanam sahasresu, not everybody wants to aspire for spiritual perfection and those who aspire for spiritual perfection are rarely one who achieve perfection and out of those perfected, one, is very rare to find one who knows Me. On one hand, Krsna is telling, I will give you that knowledge, but, in the next verse, Krsna is telling, how rare that knowledge is. 
    
    Then Krsna is imparting the knowledge and this one verse is actually very, very important to understand. The transcendental reality. Transcend means what? Going across. So, at some point, we have to go across this material world. Staying on the material nature means, material nature will never be able to understand the spiritual reality. We have to transcend this platform to go into that platform. 
    
    So Krsna is making the transition here. 
    
    bhumir apo ‘nalo vayuh kham mano buddhir eva ca ahankara itiyam me bhinna prakrtir astadha (BG 7.4) 
    
    This material nature is comprised of earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego. How many did you get? Eight? So this material nature is composed of these eight elements. But then Krishna is pointing out apareyam itas tv anyam. This material nature composed of these eight elements is apara, is inferior but beyond this inferior material nature, there is a superior nature of mine. 
    
    And jiva-bhutam maha-baho yayedam dharyate jagat. And the living entities, the jiva- bhutam who are sustaining this material nature, who are exploiting this material nature, they come from there. So you see this point. 
    
    Yesterday I mentioned in relation to Sankhya. In Sankhya, what is happening? In Sankhya philosophy, you analyze the whole material nature but then what is the purpose of this analysis? The purpose of analyzing the entire material nature is to transcend the material nature, and come to the spiritual reality. So here Krishna is actually making us transcend the material nature. This material nature consisting of these eight elements is not everything. Beyond this, there is a superior spiritual reality and we all have come from there. We are not a product of this material nature. Unfortunately modern science cannot accept that. They have concluded that living entities are a product of chemical combination. Therefore they will always remain in this endless darkness, eternal darkness. They will never be able to come to the right conclusion. They will never be able to have the proper understanding, right understanding. etad-yonini bhutani sarvanity upadharaya aham krtsnasya jagatah prabhavah pralayas tatha (BG 7.6) 
    
    “All created being have their source in these two natures.” Everything has their source and origin in these two natures, material and spiritual. “Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world, know for certain that I am both the origin and the dissolution.”
    
    Prabhavah pralayas tatha, I am the prabhavah, I am the origin and I am pralayas cause of destruction. Of course that concept of destruction does not apply in the spiritual reality because that reality is eternal, so there is no consideration of destruction of that nature. So see how systematically Krishna is now giving us this knowledge step by step. 
    
    First we are in the material nature. What this material nature, consisting of the eight elements. But beyond this material nature, there is the spiritual reality, and we all came from the spiritual reality, we all are spiritual beings and we are sustaining this material nature. We are exploiting this material nature, we are experiencing this material nature. We are experiencing. material nature relative to our personality. 
    
    If there is no one to perceive this, if there is no one here, will the material nature exist or not? It will exist but it will exist in its unmanifested form, unmanifest, not manifest. So what is causing this material nature to manifest? The appearance of the living entities in this nature. And then Krishna is pointing out that of both these material and spiritual nature, He is the origin and He is the cause of destruction. That means everything is maintained and everything is sustained by Him. Then He is saying: 
    
    mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya mayi sarvam idam protam sutre mani-gana iva (BG 7.7) 
    
    There is no one superior to Me. Krishna is broadcasting. So should you believe in Krishna? Yes. Is there anyone superior to Krishna? No. So that is the identity of Krishna. Akam eva aditya, one without a second. One without a second, supreme param. The expression param indicates that no one is equal to Him and no one is superior to Him. So He is making that point here, mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya. Sometimes people may say “oh you are Hare Krishna, that’s why you say Krishna is the greatest.” Is not our words, it’s Krishna words. And all the great saintly personalities, all the exalted souls in India, greatest spiritual personalities have accepted Bhagavat Gita as the authority. So in the Bhagavat Gita, Krishna is saying no one is superior to Him. So should we accept it? YES. Mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya mayi sarvam idam protam sutre mani- gana iva. So everything is sustained by Me, just as the tread is holding all the jewels, that in the necklace. 
    
    Raso ham. Then Krishna is pointing out that how we have to see Him in everything. Krishna, everything is being sustained by Krishna. How everything is being sustained by Krishna, how Krishna is present in everything. 
    
    raso ham apsu kaunteya prabhasmi sasi-suryayoh pranavah sarva-vedesu khe paurusam nrsu (BG 7.8) 
    
    So Krishna is telling that “O son of Kunti, I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable Om in the Vedic mantras, I am the sound in ether and ability in men.”
    
    punyo gandhah prthivyam ca tejas casmi vibhavasau jivanam sarva-bhutesu tapas casmi tapasvisu 
    
    I am the original fragrance of the earth, I am the heat in fire, I am the life of all that lives and I am the penances of all ascetics. (BG 7.9) 
    
    bijam mam sarva-bhutanam viddhi partha sanatanam buddhir buddhimatam asmi tejas tejasvinam aham 
    
    O son of Prtha, know that I am the original seed of all existence, the intelligence of the intelligence and the prowess of all powerful men.(BG7.10) 
    
    balam balavatam caham kama-raga-vivarjitam dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo ‘smi bharatarsabha 
    
    I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principle, O Lord of the bharata Arjuna. (BG7.11) 
    
    ye caiva sattvika bhava rajasas tamasas ca ye matta eveti tan viddhi na tv aham tesu te mayi Know that all state of being be they of goodness, passion or ignorance are manifested by my energy. I am in one sense everything but I am independent. I am not under the modes of material nature for they on the contrary are within me. (BG 7.12) 
    
    tribhir guna-mayair bhavair ebhih sarvam idam jagat mohitam nabhijanati mam ebhyah param avyayam 
    
    Deluded by the three modes of nature, the whole world does not know me who am above the modes and inexhaustible. (BG 7.13) 
    
    daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te 
    
    The divine energy of mine consisting of the three modes of material nature is difficult to overcome but those who have surrender unto me can easily cross beyond it. (BG7.14) 
    
    na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah mayayapahrta-jnana asuram bhavam asritah (BG 7.15) 
    
    Four kinds of people will never surrender to Krsna. Although Krsna is the Supreme, Krsna is the most merciful shelter of everyone, but still there are some people who will never surrender unto Him. Who are those? Duskritinah, those who are the miscreants. They fall in? There are four catagories of them: mudha, a fool. Mudha , na mam duskritinah mudhah. And naradhamah, nara adhamah they look like human beings but they are not human beings, naradhamah. And mayayapahrta-jnana whose knowledge have been stolen by maya and asuram bhavam asritah those who are demoniac by nature. 
    
    catur-vidha bhajante mam janah skrtino ‘rjuna arto jijnasur artharthi jnani ca bharatarsabha (BG 7.16) 
    
    And four kind of people who surrender, who are they? They are artha, they’re some people in distress they surrender unto Him. Those who are in need of money, they may surrender unto Krsna, then those who are inquisitive about the spiritual reality, they surrender unto Him, and those who are situated in proper knowledge, they surrender unto Him. So there are four kinds they are sukritinah. The word sukritinah has been translated by Srila Prabhupada as those who are pious. tesam jnani nitya-yukta eka-bhaktir visisyate priyo hi jnanino ‘tyartham aham sa ca mama priyah (BG 7.17) 
    
    Of those the one who is in full knowledge and one who is always engaged in pure devotional service is the best. Of all those people those who surrender unto Krsna, one who is in full knowledge and who is always engaged in pure devotional service. Now what is the meaning of full knowledge? Full knowledge is very simple knowledge, Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and we are His eternal servants. Now this is the full knowledge. Full knowledge doesn’t mean we have to have vast intellectual ability. Full knowledge is very simple. When the sun comes up is it very difficult to see everything? No, with the light of the sun we see everything. Similarly with this understanding, everything becomes perfectly understood. Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and we are His servants. And then what happens? 
    
    Then eka-bhaktir visisyate, then one becomes engaged in pure devotional service. So who can become a pure devotee of Krsna? Who can recognise his identity as His eternal servant. And he is very very dear to Krsna. Sometimes people make a mistake thinking “oh we have to become very learned in order to become dear to Krsna”, because Krsna is saying of those one who is in full knowledge, so we have to become jnani, NO! we don’t have to become jnani, rather we simply have to understand a very simple point that we are eternal servants of Krsna and we become engaged in His devotional service then we will become perfectly situated and then we will become very dear to Krsna. 
    
    udarah sarva evaite jnani tv atmaiva me matam asthitah sa hi yuktatma mam evanuttamam gatim (BG 7.18) 
    
    Krsna is now making this point, all these devotees, of all those devotees undoubtedly magnanimous souls, but he who is situated in knowledge of Me, I consider to be just like Me, just like My own self, atmaiva, being engaged in My transcendental service is sure to attain Me, the highest and most perfect goal. 
    
    bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma su-durlabhah (BG 7.19) 
    
    So what is the ultimate perfection of knowledge? Vasudevah sarvam iti; Vasudeva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna and He is everything, He is the source of everything, He is the maintainer of everything and He is the shelter of everything. “After many, many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very, very rare.”
    
    kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah prapadyante ‘nya-devatah tam tam niyamam asthaya prakrtya niyatah svaya 
    
    Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures. (BG 7.20) 
    
    So when somebody worships other demigods, kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah, whose knowledge has been stolen by lust. Lust, what is the meaning of lust? Lust simply means the desire to enjoy this material nature. When we have the desire to enjoy the material nature then our knowledge will be stolen hrta-jnanah and what will we do then? We will take shelter of someone other than Krsna, someone other than Krsna, anya-devatah. Anya devatah doesn’t mean just the demigods, even others, your boss you are taking shelter of him. Your political leader, you’re taking shelter of him. So when do we take shelter of others, other than Krsna? Only when our knowledge has been stolen by lust. Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures. At least those days they used to surrender to demigods now-a-days they don’t even surrender to demigods, they surrender to their boss, they surrender to the movie stars, they surrender to the politicians, they surrender to everybody else why? Because their intelligence has been stolen by lust. They think that by worshipping them, they will get their desires fulfilled. 
    
    yo yo yam yam tanum bhaktah sraddhayarcitum icchati tasya tasyacalam sraddham tam eva vidadhamy aham 
    
    I am in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship some demigod, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity. (BG 7.21) 
    
    sa taya sraddhaya yuktas tasyaradhanam ihate labhate ca tatah Kaman mayaiva vihitan hi tan 
    
    Endowed with such a faith, he endeavours to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone. (BG 7.22) antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam devan deva-yajo yanti mad-bhakta yanti mam api 
    
    Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet. (BG 7.23) 
    
    avyaktam vyaktim apannam manyante mam abuddhayah param bhavam ajananto mamavyayam anuttamam 
    
    Unintelligent men, who do not know Me perfectly, think that I, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, was impersonal before and have now assumed this personality. Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, which is imperishable and supreme. (BG 7.24) 
    
    naham prakasah sarvasya yoga-maya -samavrtah mudho yam nabhijanati loko mam ajam avyayam 
    
    I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible. (BG 7.25) 
    
    vedaham samatitani vartamanani carjuna bhavisyani ca bhutani mam-tu veda na kascana 
    
    O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities, but Me no one knows. (BG 7.26) 
    
    Krishna knows everything, Krishna knows everybody, but no one knows Krishna. 
    
    Iccha-dvesa-samutthena dvandva-mohena bharata sarva-bhutani sammohan sarge yanti parantapa 
    
    O scion of Bharata, O conqueror of the foe, all living entities are born into delusion, bewildered by dualities arisen from desire and hate. (BG 7.27)
    
    Yesam tv anta-gatam papam jananam punya-karmanam Te dvandva-moha-nirmukta bhajante mamdrdha-vratah 
    
    Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sinful actions are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination. (BG 7.28) 
    
    jara-marana-moksaya mam asritya yatanti ye te brahma tad viduh krtsnam adhyatmam karma cakhilam 
    
    Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental activities (BG 7.29) 
    
    sadhibhutadhidaivam mam sadhiyajnam ca ye viduh prayana-kale pi ca mam te vidur yukta-cetasah 
    
    Those in full consciousness of Me, who know Me, the Supreme Lord, to be the governing principle of the material manifestation, of the demigods, and of all methods of sacrifice, can understand and know Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even at the time of death. (BG 7.30). 
    
    That means even if they did not understand Krishna before, at the time of death they will positively understand Krishna. Why? Because Krishna will come to them. 
    
    What I will do now is I will divide you in five groups. How many are there? 47 total here. So nine in each group. Those who are elderly do not have to participate. Who wants to actively participate? Okay, maybe one group can come this side-nine of you-okay one group. How many others want to participate? These are the two lady groups. Men’s group at the other side-Ok, nine of you.

    So all the teams are in place? One day we did not have our interactive group discussion. It seems that so many days we did not have, so today which chapter we are going to do? You all are ready for that? So twelfth chapter is the chapter entitled: devotional service. Is it not wonderful? So devotional service is now culminating into this particular chapter. 
    
    BG 12.1 arjuna uvaca evam satata-yukta ye bhaktas tvam paryupasate ye capy aksharam avyaktam tesham ke yoga-vittamah 
    
    TRANSLATION Arjuna inquired: Which are considered to be more perfect, those who are always properly engaged in Your devotional service or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested? 
    
    If Arjuna asked this question to Prabhupada? Any way let see how Krsna is dealing with this question? 
    
    BG 12.2 sri-bhagavan uvaca mayy avesya manor ye mama nitya-yukta upasate sraddhaya parayopetas te me yuktatama matah 
    
    TRANSLATION The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: Those who fix their minds on My personal form and are always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith are considered by Me to be most perfect.

    TRANSLATION But those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the perception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, unchanging, fixed and immovable — the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth — by controlling the various senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all, at last achieve Me. 
    
    Now there is one important consideration. At last achieve me, what is the meaning of “at last achieving me?” They become complete frustrated with that endeavor, and then they give up and surrender to Krsna. By impersonal concept one cannot actually reach the absolute. Impersonalism is not the ultimate goal. One has to come, like consider all the impersonalists, those who were impersonalist at the beginning; the classic examples are four Kumaras, Sukadev Goswami. So what happened to them? Did they continue and then ultimately achieve the spiritual perfection? Or they transcended the platform and came to the platform of devotional service? So that is the meaning of the word “at last coming to me”. But look at trouble they have to go through. First of all worshiping the unmanifested that which lies beyond the perception of the senses. You can not see, you can not feel, You cannot touch, I mean so difficult to worship something that is nothing actually, and then that is all pervading inconceivable, unchanging fixed, immovable, by controlling the various senses, yogis tries to control the senses, is it easy? It is so difficult. And In order to control your senses, what we have to do? The other day we had discussed, the yogis in order to control the mind, what they have to eventually do? They have to stop breathing. Give it a try and good luck. By controlling the various senses and being equally disposed to everyone, equally disposed to everyone which means, that you 
    
    have to become like a stone. No feeling at all .So, this is how difficult it is. Such person engaged in the welfare and they become engaged in the welfare of all, and at last achieve me. And how do they at last achieve me? Because why finally when they give up realizing that this is not going to work, then they surrender unto Krsna. Then the next verses confirming that: Next sloka. 
    
    BG 12.5 kleso ‘dhikataras tesham avyaktasakta-cetasam avyakta hi gatir duhkham dehavadbhir avapyate 
    
    TRANSLATION For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied. 
    
    Those who are embodied for them it is difficult, if you are a stone, it would have been all right, but unfortunately you are not a stone. I remembered that those who used to take intoxication, they used to use that expression, to get stunned, which means to become devoid of all senses, when your senses are active, then automatically you have your perception, you have your discrimination, and you have your natural tendency for reciprocation. Next sloka: 
    
    BG 12.6-7 ye tu sarvani karmani mayi sannyasya mat-parah ananyenaiva yogena mam dhyayanta upasate tesham aham samuddharta mrityu-samsara-sagarat bhavami na cirat partha mayy avesita-cetasam 
    
    TRANSLATION But those who worship Me, giving up all their activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, having fixed their minds upon Me, O son of Pritha — for them I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death. 
    
    So, isn’t it wonderful? This is the advantage of surrendering to Krsna. You surrender to Krsna, and He will deliver you from the ocean of birth and death. mrityu-samsara- sagarat, it’s a dangerous ocean of birth and death. Another way of looking at it is you remember the other day we gave the example: of Srila Prabhupada pointing asking the difference between a dog that has master and dog that do not have master. How do they look? Don’t you immediately see the difference in them? Now what type of dog you want to be? Do you want to be a dog with a master or without a master? With a master, So, that dog who has a master, they do have any worry, they do not have to look after where the food where the food will come, and they do not have to worry so much for defending themselves. Because they are always afraid of being attacked by others. But when the dog is with a master, and somebody attack the dog, the master stands on, defends the dog. So from that you can see if you surrender to Krsna then what will happen to us? Let somebody try to do something to us, Krsna will stand against us. When Krsna stands against us. 
    
    BG 12.8 mayy eva mana adhatsva mayi buddhim nivesaya nivasishyasi mayy eva ata urdhvam na samsayah 
    
    TRANSLATION Just fix your mind upon Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and engage all your intelligence in Me. Thus you will live in Me always, without a doubt. 
    
    BG 12.9 atha cittam samadhatum na saknoshi mayi sthiram abhyasa-yogena tato mam icchaptum dhananjaya 
    
    TRANSLATION My dear Arjuna, O winner of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind upon Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. In this way develop a desire to attain Me. 
    
    BG 12.10 abhyase ‘py asamartho ‘si mat-karma-paramo bhava mad-artham api karmani kurvan siddhim avapsyasi 
    
    TRANSLATION If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work for Me, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage. 
    
    So this is how Krsna is making the tings lighter and lighter for us and what is the trick? Somehow or other you start. Krsna’s point is if you can not start at this point then start at this point, if you can not start this point start at this point. But start somewhere. If you will start then what will happen then gradually you will elevate. BG 12.11 athaitad apy asakto ‘si kartum mad-yogam asritah sarva-karma-phala-tyagam tatah kuru yatatmavan 
    
    TRANSLATION If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness of Me, then try to act giving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated. 
    
    See Krsna is making the things so easy for us. Is nt it? patram pushpam phalam toyam bg 9.26 what can be more simplier than that? 
    
    BG 12.12 sreyo hi jnanam abhyasaj jnanad dhyanam visishyate dhyanat karma-phala-tyagas tyagac chantir anantaram 
    
    TRANSLATION If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of knowledge. Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one can attain peace of mind. 
    
    BG 12.13-14 adveshta sarva-bhutanam maitrah karuna eva ca nirmamo nirahankarah sama-duhkha-sukhah kshami santushtah satatam yogi yatatma dridha-niscayah mayy arpita-mano-buddhir yo mad-bhaktah sa me priyah 
    
    TRANSLATION One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisfied, self-controlled, and engaged in devotional service with determination, his mind and intelligence fixed on Me — such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me. 
    
    BG 12.15 yasman nodvijate loko lokan nodvijate ca yah harshamarsha-bhayodvegair mukto yah sa ca me priyah TRANSLATION He for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not disturbed by anyone, who is equipoised in happiness and distress, fear and anxiety, is very dear to Me 
    
    Now the question is when can one become, when can one attain such a state? Free from happiness and distress, free from all dualities, fear and anxiety, only when one properly surrendered to Krsna. 
    
    BG 12.16 anapekshah sucir daksha udasino gata-vyathah sarvarambha-parityagi yo mad-bhaktah sa me priyah 
    
    TRANSLATION My devotee who is not dependent on the ordinary course of activities, who is pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and not striving for some result, is very dear to Me.

    TRANSLATION One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is equipoised in honor and dishonor, heat and cold, happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is always free from contaminating association, always silent and satisfied with anything, who doesn’t care for any residence, who is fixed in knowledge and who is engaged in devotional service — such a person is very dear to Me. BG 12.20 ye tu dharmamritam idam yathoktam paryupasate sraddadhana mat-parama bhaktas te ‘tiva me priyah 
    
    TRANSLATION Those who follow this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely engage themselves with faith, making Me the supreme goal, are very, very dear to Me.

function vh1() {
    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>A Vaishnava is a person who has given himself in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So in reality everyone is a Vaishnava, every soul is a part and and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and in its constitutional position every spirit soul is engaged in serving God. And in the spiritual sky everyone is serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead and therefore in the spiritual sky everyone is a Vaishnava. So it is important to remember that ISKCON is not really introducing some new religion, or some sectarian Indian religion. What ISKCON is introducing is the natural characteristic that we have, taking us back to our original constitutional position. The purpose of ISKCON is to train us to be what we actually are.

    What we are now is not what we actually are. Some of us are thinking that we are Indians, and others are thinking that they are South Africans, and still others that they are white, black, men, women, animals, insects, and so on.  But these are our mistaken identities – the ones which we develop due to our forgetfulness.
    
    Although this Vaishnavism started at the beginning or creation of this universe, it is not that it originated just at that point. It always existed
    
    in the spiritual sky. So in the spiritual sky everyone is a Vaishnava. So when we go back to the spiritual sky, we will find out that everyone is
    
    serving Krishna, and therefore everyone there is a Vaishnava. And when we are here, it will be very important for us to try and become Vaishnavas. And when we become Vaishnavas then we go back to the spiritual sky, not otherwise. Unless and until you become a Vaishnava, a servant of Vishnu or Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no way you can go back to the spiritual sky. So this is what Srila Prabhupada came and gave us and if we take full advantage of this we will be able to make our life successful. So actually we have a very unique heritage. Sometimes people get into a conflict in India and in the West also, thinking, “My religion is better than yours.” Don’t they? There is a constant conflict all over it. Even in India the people are fighting. Those who are worshippers of Shiva say that Shiva is greater than Vishnu. Those who are worshippers of Durga say that Durga is greater than Vishnu and so on. Similarily in the west the Christians are saying that you all are Hindus, all nonsense, Christianity is the only way. Similarily the Muslims are saying that convert everyone to Islam otherwise they are doomed. But actually the real religion of every living entity is to become a servant of Vishnu. It is unfortunate that in
    
    today’s world people are making this discrimination on religion.
    
    Actually Jesus Christ also came to make his followers Vaishnavas, and Jesus was a Vaishnava himself. He knew God whom he addressed as his father, and asked everyone to love Him, and when somebody loves someone else then automatically he becomes engaged in his service. So what did Jesus preach? What is the real teaching of Jesus Christ? Become a servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So where is the problem? We don’t have any problem, but unfortunately those who develop a misunderstanding of Jesus’ teachings have a problem.
    
    So do Mohammad’s followers. Mohammad had to come, teach and preach to people who were not very advanced. You can very well imagine how the desert people are! And how must the people have been thousands of years ago? Therefore he gave them very basic understanding. But when somebody considers that basic understanding as the ultimate way, then the whole world will be in trouble. Like if a primary school kid thinks that primary school education is the ultimate education, you can imagine what is going to happen to the educational system. And then these primary school kids will go to the university and force everybody, “you have to accept the primary school education.” So this is how today’s spiritual education is facing such an acute crisis.
    
    And that is why it is very important that we understand scientifically what real religion is. Religion actually means the inherent characteristic of a substance. The Sanskrit word for religion is “Dharma”. Now, what’s the meaning of the word “Dharma”? “Dharma” actually means the inherent characteristic of a substance. For example, water is a substance; wherever there is water, it is liquid. So this liquidity of water is its inherent characteristic. When water loses its liquidity and becomes solid, we don’t call it water but ice. Or when water becomes vaporized, we call it vapor. Similarly, fire is a substance and wherever there is fire there is heat and light. Therefore, light and heat are the inherent characteristics of fire and thus are the “dharma” of fire.
    
    Similarly, spirit soul is a substance and the inherent characteristic of spirit soul is its dharma. What is that inherent characteristic? That is to
    
    love God. Just like when water becomes solid it becomes something else, similarly when a living entity stops to love God, he becomes a conditioned soul. That is what has happened to us. As pure spirit souls we should be loving God. Although we may stop to love God, the propensity to love is always there. Wherever there is a soul there is the propensity to love someone. A man loves a woman; the servant loves his master and so on. This tendency to love is always there, so much so that even a lion loves its cub.  Even a snake loves his female counterpart. So this tendency to love is there in every living entity. But unfortunately they forgot whom to love. Through
    
    this love they actually want to derive joy.
    
    Actually love and joy are interrelated. Through love one enjoys or through love one wants to enjoy. But until and unless one loves Krishna one cannot enjoy, his experience of joy will always be frustrated. When a young man falls in love with a young girl, what does he think? He thinks that through this love he is going to become the happiest man in the world, but what happens at the end of the day? I don’t have to tell you that. So this is the reality. But as soon as one begins to love Krishna, he immediately begins to experience joy. So this desire to love Krishna is actually the dharma of the living entity. Therefore it is called “Sanatana Dharma”. Sanatana means eternal. Why it is called eternal dharma? Because the living entity is eternal, therefore the inherent characteristic of the living entity is also eternal. Is it not a logical conclusion? Therefore the eternal religion of a living entity is called “Sanatana Dharma”.
    
    When we come to the material nature, it is because of our own volition that we come here; we choose to come to this material nature. Sometimes people ask why Krishna sent us to this material nature. The answer is that Krishna never sent you; it is you who opted and desired to come to the material nature. And that is why we want to stay in this material nature. My answer to them is that now Krishna has shown you the way to the spiritual nature, then why don’t you get out of this material nature and go back to Krishna? Why don’t you do that? Krishna says “Sarva dharmana parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja, give up all your nonsense and just surrender unto Me and you
    
    will go back to Godhead.” Then why don’t you do that? Why you came to the material nature is not important. That shows that we want to stay in this material nature. People generally worry about what would happen when they get out of this material nature. “What will happen to my family, my business, to this world?” But everything will go on fine, just wonderfully without us. And some day we have to go out of this material nature. Then what? Whether we like it or not, whether we want it or not, one day we will have to leave. Therefore it is wise not to be attached to the material nature, but rather to go back to the spiritual world.
    
    In order to go back to the spiritual sky one has to become a Vaishnava. And how does one become a Vaishnava? That has been pointed out by Krishna. At the beginning of creation, Krishna actually gave the process as to how one can become a Vaishnava. And that knowledge is called Veda. The knowledge that Krishna gave is called Veda. He imparted that knowledge to Brahma, and so Brahma is the first Vaishnava and then Brahma gave this knowledge to Narada. This knowledge came from Narada to Vyasa, and in this way through the disciplic succession it is flowing down and the process of becoming a Vaishnava is going on. Anybody can become a Vaishnava. Anybody can become situated in his constitutional position. Isn’t it a natural right that we all have? Everybody can actually become what he really is. So this is our heritage that Krishna the Supreme Personality of Godhead gave for us to become purified and freed from our material bondage. So we will be purified
    
    straight away.

}function vh2() {
    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>In the last session we discussed that Vaishnavism or Vaishnava religion is the eternal characteristic of a living entity. And in this way we came to the understanding that a pure devotee is a person or a pure Vaishnava is he who does not have any other desire than serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Today we will discuss about the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a devotee, as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

    The Supreme Personality of Godhead descends in order to establish sanatana- dharma, the eternal religion of the living entity. This sanatana-dharma or Vaishnavism is the means by which the living entity can be freed from the material contamination and become qualified to go back to the spiritual sky.
    
    A Vaishnava is actually a pure spirit soul. And what is the meaning of a pure spirit soul? The pure spirit soul is the soul that is completely free
    
    from this material contamination. Although he may be in the material nature but he is not affected by the material nature. That is actually a pure devotee. The Supreme God comes from time to time to establish this eternal religion. But in this age of Kali, particularly in this age… This age of Kali is a very special age. The time cycle just before this one that we are in, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared in His original identity in his svayam rupa. And in the following Kali-yuga He appeared as a devotee. And by appearing as a pure devotee He preaches how to become a pure devotee. Now is this point clear to everybody that in this age Krishna appeared as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. If it is not clear then I will try to elaborate on this a little more. So it’s clear to everybody. To how many it’s clear ? Raise your hands. Okay, so it’s clear and no need to explain.
    
    Actually the time cycle in a larger concept is the chatur-viyuga, the cycle that consists of Satya-yuga, Treta-yuga, Dwapara-yuga and Kali-yuga. So that makes one cycle. And thousands of such cycles make a day of Brahma. And once in a day of Brahma the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna appears. Which cycle out of this one thousand it is ? How many of you know, raise your hands. Okay, only Nrishingananda knows.
    
    Every day of Brahma has thousand of cycles. And in the 28th cycle of chatur-viyuga, in Dwapara-yuga Krishna appears in His svayam rupa, in His original identity as Krishna. And in the following Kali-yuga the Lord appears as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So this is that Kali-yuga. And appearing in this age Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gives a very strong fortune for the living entity. And what is that good fortune? Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu opens the door of Vrindavana for anyone and everyone. Now let us discuss about the geography of the spiritual sky.
    
    Beyond the material nature there is the causal ocean. This material nature consists on innumerable universes. And those universes are like bubbles created by Mahavishnu’s breathing. Maha-Vishnu is lying in which ocean? In the causal ocean. Causal ocean means He lies in the ocean of cause. Just like there is an ocean of water, there is an ocean of a substance called cause. And as He breathes the bubbles that are created due to his breath is a universe. And in this way there are innumerable universes caused by the breathing of Maha-Vishnu. Now if you consider the universe we are situated in one such universe. So if you go out of the universe what will you find? If we get out of this universe we will find cause, the causal ocean.
    
    Now beyond that causal ocean is brahma-jyoti. The spiritual light that emanates from the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And beyond that brahma-jyoti there are innumerable Vaikuntha planets. In the spiritual sky also there are many spiritual planets. Those spiritual planets are known as Vaikuntha. And in Vaikuntha the presiding personality is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Narayana form or in His different forms like Sankarshana, Vamana, Varaha, Kurma etc. The Lord is present in each planet along with His devotee.
    
    And in those planets the Lord is worshipped by His devotees with awe and reverence.  There the Lord is present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Lord is worshipped by all the exalted personalities as the eternal servant. And in this way if you go even higher in the region of Vaikuntha, then we will come across the Vaikuntha planet called Ayodhya. And there Lord Ramachandra is residing along with His devotees. Even higher than Ayodhya is Dwaraka where Krishna stays with [unclear] and His devotees. And even beyond Dwaraka is Mathura mandala. And beyond Mathura is Vrindavana. And in Vrindavana the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna resides along with His devotees.
    
    Now there is a difference between Vaikuntha and Vrindavana.  In Vaikuntha God resides with His devotees who worship Him with great awe and reverence as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all the devotees serve the Lord as the servant. So the predominating mood in Vaikuntha is servitorship.
    
    Everyone serves the Lord and the Lord is the Supreme Master.  But in Vrindavana the Supreme Personality of Godhead allows His devotees to
    
    develop some very special relationships and these are friendship, parental and conjugal. These relationships are deeper and more intense and
    
    progressively become even more intense and intimate. Now for example, say in your house you have a servant so you have some relationship with your servant. But your relationship with your friend is different than the relationship with your servant. Isn’t it?
    
    Then your relationship with your parents is even more intimate than with your friend. And your relationship with your wife is even more intimate than with your parents. So in this way we see that the conjugal relationship or the relationship between the lover and the loved is the highest or the most intimate relationship. Now in Vrindavana the Supreme Personality of Godhead allows His devotees to develop these very keen intimate relationships, friendship, parental and conjugal.
    
    Whereas in Vaikuntha these relationships are not available. In Vaikuntha no one is the Lord’s friend, everyone is the servant. Now in Ayodhya which is higher than the Vaikuntha planets, because in Ayodhya we see that Hanuman although he is serving the Lord as the servant is developing a relationship akin to friendship. There the Lord asks Hanuman, “Hanuman ask anything you want from me”. And Hanuman says “My Lord if you so desire, give me Your embrace.” And Lord Ramachandra embraced Hanuman.
    
    So here servitorship is merging into friendship. The friendship is not ever lasting. Hanuman’s real or basic relationship with the Lord is that of a servant. But when we go to Dwaraka we find that Uddhava has a more established friendship with Krishna. That’s why Dwaraka is even higher than Ayodhya. But when we go to Vrindavana we find that Krishna serves His friends. They treat Krishna just like their friend. And they don’t care that Krishna is God. That is due to the influence of Yogamaya.
    
    Now Maya means illusion and Yogamaya is the spiritual illusion or the illusion caused by love. There are two types of illusions. Illusion due
    
    to ignorance that is in the material nature, but what is that illusion ? We
    
    do not know who Krishna is. But in Vrindavana they do not treat Krishna as
    
    God. Due to some sort of illusion. Krishna is the Supreme Personality of
    
    Godhead and therefore worshippable. But in Vrindavana Krishna’s friends don’t treat him as God. Why ? Due to illusion. It is not due to ignorance but due to illusion. Their love is so intense and deep that they don’t care if Krishna is God or not.
    
    Just like if a person becomes the state president, does his mother treat him like the state president? No. Why? Because of love for him, because of the intense love. Similarly in Vrindavan the devotees don’t treat Krishna as God, because they treat Him as a friend. And some other individuals in Vrindavana they treat Krishna as their son, like mother Yasoda and Nanda Maharaja. And in Vrindavana some individuals treat Krishna as their lover.
    
    Just like a young girl falls in love with a young boy, these gopis
    
    have fallen in love with Krishna. And that’s what all they care. All they
    
    care is that Krishna is the object of their love. And they want to dance
    
    with Krishna, have loving exchanges with Krishna. And that’s about all they
    
    want. And whether Krishna is God or not they don’t bother. And as a matter
    
    of fact even when God comes in front of them, they neglect God and go after
    
    Krishna.
    
    For example, when the gopis were dancing with Krishna in Vrindavana,
    
    the rasa dance, at one point Krishna left them, at the dead of night.
    
    Krishna playing his flute invited all these young damsels of Vrindavan and
    
    then He was dancing with them and all of a sudden he left them. And all
    
    these young girls in the dead of the forest in the middle of the night they
    
    were searching for Krishna. And they kept searching and crying. And the song
    
    that we just sung displays there intense feeling of separation from Krishna.
    
    And when the gopis were searching in this way, Krishna just to have fun
    
    achieved his four-armed Narayana form and stood there in their way. So
    
    the gopis saw Narayana and offered their respectful obeisances to Him and
    
    prayed to Him that please bless us that we can find Krishna. So the gopis know that Narayana is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but then they are not interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are simply in
    
    love, all that they care is simply Krishna.
    
    It is not that they don’t know that Krishna is God. But out of love they barely care about the fact that Krishna is God. So in this song of separation that we just sang, “jayati te ‘dhikam janmana vrajah”. Ever since you took birth in Vrindavana, Vrindavan has become glorious. “Srayata indira sasvad atra hi”. And Lakshmi devi has taken permanent residence here. Because she is the eternal consort of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So they knew that Krishna is Narayana. And Krishna took birth in Vrindavana, Lakshmidevi is also residing there because she is the eternal consort of Narayana.
    
    The next paragraph will actually reveal that point. So they know that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are saying ‘na khalu gopika-nandano bhavan, akhila-dehinam antaratma-drik’. They are saying that you are not the son of the gopi yasoda ‘na khalu gopika-nandano bhavan’, you are the Supreme soul residing in every living entity, ‘akhila-dehinam antaratma-drik’. So they know that Krishna is God. But their attitude is even if you are God so what?
    
    It doesn’t really matter to us. So that is the meaning of Yogamaya. So this is due to the arrangement of Yogamaya. Yogamaya affects the relationship with Krishna. Now you can understand that this type of relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very, very rare. Actually everyone is actually a servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahma is a servant of Narayana. Shiva is a servant of Narayana. Lakshmidevi is a maid servant of Narayana. So you can see that all the great personalities are serving the Lord in the mood of servitorship.
    
    But the residents of Vrindavana treat Krishna as a friend. So whose position is higher ? Lord Brahma and Shiva are serving Narayana as servants. Whose position is higher, the residents of Vrindavana. And in Vaikuntha everyone is serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Lord. But the residents of Vrindavana have the facility or the opportunity to serve Krishna as a friend. So whose position is higher, the residents of Vrindavana. So in this way we can feel that the residents of Vrindavana have a very, very special relationship with Krishna that even the residents of Vaikuntha do not have. Now is this point clear to everyone ?
    
    Does anybody have any questions up to this point that we discussed? It is not just a lecture, but a seminar; it is a class to have a proper understanding. So that’s why at this point I would stop and ask if anybody has any questions?
    
    Let’s deal with the point which we have discussed so far. Lord Shiva is not just an ordinary demigod. The demigods are called devas, but lord Shiva is known as Mahadeva, the greatest of all the demigods. And also the speciality of Lord Shiva is that he is an incarnation of Vishnu, he is a Gunavatara.  Lord Shiva is a transformation of Vishnu. Vishnu doesn’t deal with the material nature directly, the material nature is his external energy.  Because if He does that, then the material energy will become his internal potency not an external potency.
    
    Therefore in order to deal with the material energy Vishnu transformed himself in to Lord Shiva. So lord Shiva is actually a direct transformation of Vishnu to deal with the material nature. And it is through Lord Shiva that all the living entities are projected into the material nature. So that’s why Lord Shiva is the greatest of all the demigods. Since he is dealing with the entire material nature he can be classified as a demigod, but the supreme demigod. That’s why Lord Shiva is the husband of Mahamaya. And he is the greatest devotee, because it is through Lord Shiva that the living entities came into the material nature. And it is through Lord Shiva that the living entities will go back to the spiritual sky.
    
    So he is actually performing some function for the sake of Vishnu, therefore he is the greatest Vaishnava. Okay I think I should just continue because many of the questions will be answered in the next part that we will be discussing and then I will come back and answer these questions. Can you bear with me a little longer?
    
    So the point actually was, whether you all understood the difference between Vaikuntha and Vrindavana. Very good, you all are very intelligent and attentive audience. So Krishna in Vrindavana, he resides in the spiritual Vrindavana. But that Krishna comes down to the material nature once in the day of Brahma. Now let me see how attentively you are listening. How many chatur-yugas make a day of Brahma?
    
    1000, Okay. So out of these 1000 chatur-yugas. Satya-yuga, treta-yuga,  dwapara yuga and Kali-yuga make 1 chatur-yuga. And the duration of this 1 chatur-yuga is 4.32 million years. So multiply it by 1000. So 4.32 billion years is a day of Brahma. And the same is the duration of Brahma’s night.
    
    And in this way Brahma lives up to 100 years, according to that calculation. The day of Brahma is of 8,64 billion years. So 30 such days make a month, 12 such months make a year. And 100 such years make a life of Brahma. Now once in a day of Brahma the Supreme Personality of Godhead comes to perform his Vrindavana pastimes. And by enacting or revealing his Vrindavan pastimes, God informs the living entity what His Vrindavana pastimes are like. And in those pastimes some very fortunate souls get a chance to participate.
    
    Actually when Krishna enacts His Vrindavana pastimes, Krishna’s associates come along with Him to take part in this pastime. Like Nanda Maharaja, mother Yasoda, Radharani, Lalita, Vishakha, Shubal, Shridam, Vasuda, these are all the associates of Krishna in Goloka Vrindavana. They came along with Krishna in Vrindavana and perform their pastimes. And those living entities who have developed some very very special relationship with Krishna due to their inconceivable good fortune and the mercy of the Lord. They get a chance to participate in Krishna’s pastimes in Vrindavana.
    
    For example, when Lord Ramachandra was performing his pastimes in the Treta Yuga, some sages in Dandakaranya… When Lord Ramchandra was in exile from his kingdom for 14 years, residing in Dandakaranya for a while. And in Dandakaranya some sages actually developed some intense love for Lord Ramchandra. They actually felt some kind of conjugal relationship with Lord Ramchandra. And Lord Ramchandra told them that look in this pastime I have only one wife and I can’t allow you this relationship, because I can’t be unfaithful to my wife. But when I will come in the Dwapara-yuga as Krishna, then I will fulfill your desire and develop a loving relationship.
    
    So these sages of Dandakaranya, some took birth in Vrindavana during Krishna’s pastimes as the gopis. The 108 exponents of the Upanishads they also got a chance to be elevated to Krishna’s Vrindavana pastimes. In this way some very, very few fortunate souls got the opportunity to get into Krishna’s Vrindavana pastimes. When Krishna enacted those pastimes on this planet.
    
    Now performing these pastimes on this planet, Krishna considered that I perform my renowned pastimes to the living entities of this world. But not many will have access to this pastime. Why ? Krishna considered a devotee serves the Supreme Personality of Godhead in awe and reverence. A devotee serves the Lord as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and his mood is that of a servant. And by serving the Lord in this mood which is known as Vaidhi bhakti.
    
    Following all the rules and regulations when they attain their perfection for devotion, they will attain Vaikuntha. One serves the Lord following Vaidhi bhakti, following the rules and regulations, one attains the Vaikuntha.  Now every devotee will serve the Lord in awe and reverence in Vaidhi bhakti, so everyone will enter Vaikuntha, where he attains his perfection. Then how will anybody get a chance to enter Vrindavan ? So Krishna considered that point. Now is this point clear ? Okay, very smart audience I have here today.
    
    So then Krishna considered how my devotees will have the opportunity to enter my Vrindavan pastimes. Therefore Krishna made a very special arrangement. What is that special arrangement ? Krishna appeared as a devotee and by serving the Lord as a devotee. And by following the scriptures the rules and regulations of the Vaidhi bhakti one will get an opportunity to enter Vrindavana. That is the reason why Krishna came as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. This is a very very important point. And every Gaudiya Vaishnava must understand this point
    
    Why we need to follow the rules and regulations of the Vaidhi bhakti when we can enter the pastimes of Vrindavana ? Following the rules and regulations and applying those rules and regulations of devotion to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Everyone serves Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead according to the rules and regulations of the scriptures. We cannot serve whimsically. We can just walk along and put our hands along His shoulders and ask “Hi Krishna! How are you doing?” We can’t do that. Or to be more precise I will give an example how impossible it is to develop this relationship of friendship with Krishna.
    
    Now in friendship the friends of Krishna in Vrindavana play with Him. And sometimes in the play they wrestle, and the condition is that the loser will have to carry the winner on his back. And when wrestling with his friends Krishna is defeated and according to the condition of the referee the loser will have to carry the winner on his back. And when the winner says Krishna now you will have to carry me on your back, Krishna says not I will not carry you, I didn’t lose actually. I just slipped over a banana peel. And when I just slipped then you jumped on me and not you are claiming that you won. So I won’t carry you. Then the friend says Krishna you are defeated, you have to carry me. Krishna says nothing doing, I am not going to carry you.
    
    Then the friend forces his way on to Krishna’s back, and for that he puts his foot on Krishna’s back. Now which devotee will dare to walk up to the alter and get on Krishna’s body. Will any devotee ever dare to do that? So that is why direct Vrindavana relationship is not possible. This relationship can only develop when we are under the influence of Yogamaya. Therefore we have to come under the influence of Yogamaya in order to come under the influence of Yogamaya. Now how does one come under the influence of Yogamaya in this way ? By Krishna’s mercy. But Krishna cannot be partial to anybody. Krishna’s doesn’t say I am into My [unclear] so I will bestow My mercy unto them and let them enter Vrindavana. Krishna doesn’t act like that he is completely neutral. Now Krishna is afraid of one thing that people may say that He is partial. So Krishna always remains impartial.

    Hare Krishna! Should I take the attendance now? It seems that many are not present as yet. They generally come in a little later. Anyway…
    
    Everything that happens, every important incident that happens, and which is recorded chronologically is called history. So whatever had been happening in the Vaishnava movement, as we discussed, from the beginning of creation, is called Vaishnava history or culture, and that is what our heritage is. Krishna consciousness movement is not a new movement that started only 30 or 33 years ago, but this movement actually started at the very beginning of creation. And not only it started at the beginning of creation, but it exists eternally in the spiritual sky.
    
    Every living entity, in its constitutional position, is a Vaishnava. One ceases to be a Vaishnava only when he is conditioned by the material nature. And that is what our heritage is. Krishna consciousness is not just a new movement or a cult. It is an age old, eternally existing spiritual characteristic of the living entities.
    
    Now, we were considering how Krishna consciousness began in this universe. We all are acquainted with that concept, how it began. It began at the time of creation. When Brahma was confused, then Krishna came and gave this Krishna consciousness to him. Until yesterday we discussed how this movement had been spreading, or has been continuing through disciplic succession from Brahma to Narada and then it continued, and there had been some decline from time to time. When irreligiosity prevailed, then Vaishnava culture became obscured to some extent. And whenever the Vaishnava culture became obscured, then the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself came to reestablish this Vaishnava culture and that is the purpose of His incarnation. And in this way time actually moves through the higher concept called the yugas – satya yuga, treta yuga, dvapara yuga and kali yuga.
    
    In satya yuga, dharma is very, very intact – the people are pious. The people are pious means they follow the principles of Vaishnava culture. True dharma is actually Vaishnava dharma. Impersonalism, although it is recognized as Dharma in India in the recent years, in the recent past, but impersonalism is not really the dharma. Shaivites, shaktas, they are not really the followers of religious principles. They are kind of deviations. The real dharma is Vaishnava dharma. To be surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the dharma. Dharma doesn’t mean to put up somebody else as the competitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to follow him. That is what the Shaivites and Shaktas do. Yesterday I intended to touch that part but I deliberately avoided because it takes up lot of time. But anyway, briefly I will describe.
    
    Shaivites means the followers of Lord Shiva, and Shaktas means the worshippers of Devi, the female form of the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mahamaya, the personification of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the cause of the material creation, or who is the controller of the material creation. The Lord glances towards Mahamaya and the material nature becomes manifest. That form of Mahamaya, or that personality of Mahamaya is the worshipable Deity of the Shaktas, the worshippers of Shakti, or energy, power.
    
    In the modern vedic concept, the Shaivites and Shaktas, the worshipers of Lord Siva and the worshipers of Devi are considered to be followers of religion. But if we consider from the pure vedic point of view, then we can see that they are not really followers of dharma – it is a kind of deviation from dharma. The true dharma is to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to become the devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There cannot possibly be any compromise. Of course, it is not that we are forbidding people from worshiping Shiva or Devi, but they have to be worshiped with the right understanding. And the right understanding is that Shiva is a Vaishnava and Devi is a Vaishnavi – Durga, Kaali, all these forms are Vaishnavis.
    
    Now, worshiping them as Vaishnavas is alright. There is nothing wrong in it. Because worshiping them as Vaishnava means just as a Vaishnava worships another exalted Vaishnava. The devotees do worship them. But the difference between these worshipers of Lord Shiva, the Vaishnava, and the Shaivites, is that the Shaivites, the so-called followers of Lord Siva put up Lord Shiva as the competitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, the Shaktas put up Kali as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But the real worship should be done with the understanding that they are devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In that worship, there is nothing wrong. It is rather advantageous. It is advantageous to worship them as Vaishnavas and Vaishnavis. Now, the spiritual culture, the Vedic culture went on in Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, practically unhindered. Because whenever there was difficulty, the Supreme Personality of Godhead came and rectified the situation.
    
    But the trouble actually starts in the age of Kali. The trouble starts in the age of Kali. That we discussed yesterday, how Kali actually used the brahmanas to destroy the brahminical culture or Vedic culture. The protectors, care-takers and the executors of Vedic culture are the brahmanas. But Kali very expertly contaminated the brahminical culture through the brahmanas by making demoniac people take birth in the brahminical families. Those who were the executors of the brahminical culture,they were made to become the destroyers of the brahminical culture and they introduced all kinds of deviant and abominable activities in the name of Vedic culture.
    
    And when, in this way, the Vedic culture was very badly affected and almost destroyed, then the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Lord Buddha. And Lord Buddha made the followers of Vedic culture reject the Vedas. Now, the question may arise why the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Lord Buddha rejected the Vedas, which is the very foundation of the spiritual culture of this world. The reason was, all kinds of abominable activities, all kinds of sinful activities were going on in the name of Vedic culture, Vedic religion. Therefore, in order to stop that, Buddha told them to reject the Vedas.
    
    Actually, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead makes His plans, His plans are quite extensive. It just doesn’t happen all of a sudden. It is not that He comes and in one moment He rectifies the situation. He takes His time. Because we have to understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead deals with eternal time. Therefore there is no dearth of time in His case. He has all the time. We may become impatient and say, “Why nothing is happening? Why there are so many difficulties and troubles and nothing is happening? No one is rectifying?” But the Lord will take His time and do His job. And it may take a few hundred years, it may take a few generations or even a few hundred years, but it will happen. Now here we can see the Lord’s wonderful plan.
    
    He came as Lord Buddha and the first thing He did is to reject the Vedas. He said, “There is no need to follow the Vedas.” Because in the name of the Vedas all kinds of abominable activities were going on. So He said, “No need to follow the Vedas”. Therefore the people who were involved in those abominable activities in the name of the Vedas, they just gave it up, gave up those abominable activities. And then He established some very simple principles of religion. He had 10 principles of how to become good. That is, always speak the truth, stay on the path of righteousness, do not inflict pain upon others, do not be violent on others, try to be compassionate towards others, so on and so forth. And He pointed out, that the goal of life is nirvana. And nirvana means to merge into nothing. That’s why His philosophy is known as Voidism.
    
    So we can see that the Vedas are giving the description that there is another reality beyond this material nature, the spiritual reality, and this material nature is a perverted reflection of that spiritual reality. But that concept was totally rejected, and Buddha just pointed out that the goal of life is to become one with nothing, or to become nothing. Ultimately the goal of life is to become nothing. And He had a whole philosophy to establish that point. And the point is something like, “this material nature is full of suffering. So our existence, our body, our entity is the source of suffering. So, when we become nothing, there won’t be any suffering.” Sounds convincing, does it not? (Laughs) If you don’t have any better philosophy than this, then this sounds fine. Yes, our existence causes misery. So, become nothing, and there won’t be any misery.
    
    So this was Buddha’s teaching, and at that time, you will be surprised to know that entire India practically became Buddhists. Brahminical culture was just existing in some pockets. And tremendous thrust actually came from the patronage of the kings, especially Ashoka. And the kshatriyas started to become atheists.
    
    Around that time another personality came, his name is Mahavira, and he is drawing the line similar to Buddhism, but he is drawing the line from Rishabhadeva. From Rishabhadeva to king Arhat. King Arhat was actually an imitator of Lord Rishabhadeva. He saw that Rishabhadeva was actually moving around like a mad man. He was not having any external consciousness. He was not wearing any clothes. He was not having any awareness of what was going on around him. Yet, thousands of people were following him. So he thought, king Arhat thought, “Although I am a king, people do not show me this kind of respect. My followers are not as loyal to me as to this person. So, if I start behaving like this person, then people will accept me as a very great personality. So he started to externally imitate Rishabhadeva. This has been recorded in Srimad Bhagavatam. King Arhad was actually the king of the province called Konka and Venka, and then there were different tirthankaras.
    
    Anyway, Mahavira actually drew the line from that. He thought that Buddha is gaining such popularity, and he thought that let me come up with another philosophy which is similar to that, and people will follow me also. And he presented that philosophy and basically the Vaisyas started to follow Mahavira. So in this way, in India the kshatriyas started to follow Buddha and the Vaisyas started to follow Mahavira as their opposition or revolt against the brahminical culture. So, as opposed to the brahminical culture, they came up with these 2 ideas. The kshatriyas generally follow Lord Buddha, and Vaisyas followed Mahavira. So the followers of Mahavira are known as Jains. And you will see in India still today most of the vaisyas are Jains. Anyway, in this way, India’s spiritual culture saw a major deviation from the Vedic culture, from the Vedas.
    
    So, after Buddhism had been established and the principle of non-violence had been established and the Vedic scriptures had practically been rejected, at that time Sankaracharya came. And Sankaracharya defeated Buddhism. Sankaracharya basically followed one logic, “you all speak of nirvana”, he challenged the Buddhists, “You all are presenting that the goal of life is nirvana and you are saying that nirvana means “nothing”. But this concept of nirvana is from the Vedas. And according to the Vedas, nirvana means to become one with everything.” A completely opposite presentation – nirvana means to merge or to become one with the Absolute. But that Absolute is impersonal.
    
    Now the question may arise, “Why did Sankaracharya present that philosophy?” He presented that philosophy because if he presented the entire vedic understanding to the Buddhists, then the Buddhists would immediately reject it, saying, “well, that is your religion. That is completely different from ours. You just carry on with your religion; we will carry on with our religion.” But Sankaracharya’s mission was to drive Buddhism out of India. Therefore he made this challenge, that “your nirvana, the concept of nirvana is a Vedic concept, and nirvana means to become one with the ultimate absolute, which is the cause of everything, and everything is that Brahman, the spiritual energy.” Now Sankaracharya, in this way, very expertly, established the Vedas. And then, after Sankaracharya reestablished the Vedas and impersonalism had been established, then came Ramanujacarya, and Ramanujacarya came and established his philosophy known as visisthadvaitadvada, over Sankaracharya’s kevaladvaitadvada. The pure, kevala advaita vada. Kevala means “only” and advaita means non-dual, that means One, which can be termed as absolute monism.
    
    But Ramanujacarya established his special concept of non-duality. The spiritual reality is non-dual. But then again, from the material perspective it is non-dual, it is one, but when we go there, then we find that there is variety. But the way Ramanujacarya defeated Sankaracarya’s philosophy is very interesting. Ramanujacarya made a few points. Sankaracarya established that the forms that one worships, that mainly five different forms: form of Vishnu, form of Surya, form of Ganesh, form of Shiva and form of Devi – these five different forms are actually imaginary. In the initial stage, one cannot meditate upon the impersonal. Therefore one needs a form. But when one becomes accomplished in meditation, then he doesn’t need the forms, he can throw the forms away and he can meditate upon the impersonal absolute.
    
    And Sankaracharya’s philosophy was that this nature is actually illusory. You see, impersonalism is also a vedic concept. At one stage, the Vedas do accept impersonalism. That impersonalism of the Vedas is known as brahmavada. And that Brahman is the spiritual energy and the spiritual energy is impersonal, but that energy is transformed into variety, which gives rise to the objects of this material nature. Like Brahman transforms gradually into pradhana, mahat-tattva, then into mind intelligence, false ego, then ether, fire, air, water, earth. In this way, they are transformations, gradually, gives rise to this material nature. But Shankaracarya pointed out that actually it is not transformation, because the Absolute cannot be transformed. It is only illusion. So the transformation theory is known as parinama vada – transformation of Brahman into material nature.
    
    But Sankaracharya established a theory called vivarta vada, or the theory of illusion. Everything is illusion, everything is illusory, and he gave the example: just as one mistakes a rope to be a snake, just as one mistakes a mirage to be water, similarly, this material nature is illusory. So, Ramanujacharya pointed out that “Fine, the rope may appear like a snake, one may mistake a rope to be a snake, but somewhere the snake must be existing, that’s why we are mistaking a rope to be a snake. Fine, in the mirage there is no water, but somewhere the water must be existing, that’s why we are mistaking the mirage to be water. Therefore, we may consider that this is illusory, the variety of this material nature, but somewhere this variety must be existing and that’s why we are mistaking this nature to be that reality. So in this way Ramanujacharya defeated Sankaracharya’s kevaladvaita vada and he established visistadvaita vada and this is how personalism was established once again.
    
    And then came Madhvacarya and he also made a massive onslaught on Sankaracarya’s impersonalism. In this way, Vaishnavism had once again been established, but still there was a conflict, there was a continuous conflict between the impersonalists and the Vaishnavas. Sankaracharya’s followers and the Vaishnavas. There were even violent attacks, lots of persecutions – Ramanujacharya’s life was in danger many times. They tried to kill him, these impersonalists tried to kill Ramanujacharya even when he was just a young boy. It is a very interesting life actually, Ramanujacharya’s life. Same thing with Madhvacharya.
    
    Then Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu presented acintya bhedabheda tattva and in this way Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu harmonized both the impersonal and the personal concepts. And His point was that acintya – the subject matter that we are discussing about is acintya – beyond our mental concoction – beyond the region of our thoughts, beyond our sense perception. Therefore, the first thing He established is that this subject matter is beyond our sense perception. Therefore, depending on our sense perception, we will never be able to come to the right understanding. Acintya khalu ye bhava na tams tarkena yojayet – the thing that is beyond our sense perception, that is beyond the realm of our thoughts cannot be established by mere arguments and logic. Is it clear? Does it make sense? The thing that is beyond our sense perception, can we establish that by our arguments and logic? No. therefore one must accept the evidence of the scriptures and the explanations of the acharyas. And in this way Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu pointed out that subject, that region is beyond our sense perception and that subject is beyond our intellectual verification.
    
    Therefore just accept the authority of the scriptures and the self-realized souls. And then He established that that spiritual reality is one, at the same time different. From one point of view it is one. From another point of view it is different. And the subject matter of discussion and consideration are three basically. Ishvara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, prakriti and jiva. Between Ishvara and prakrti there is similarity and difference, between the jiva and Ishvara there is similarity and difference, and between jiva and prakrti there is similarity and difference. So, in simple words, this is the sum and substance of acintya bhedabheda. So in this way Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu established the acintya bhedabheda tattva or the perfect Vaishnava understanding.
    
    Not only Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave that, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, in order to draw everyone into His fold, He started a movement called the sankirtan movement. On one hand Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave the highest spiritual philosophy, highest spiritual understanding. But at the same time, He gave the process which is very simple and sublime. Whether one can understand the philosophy or not anyone can participate. And the process that Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave is just sing and dance and honor Krishna prasadam – a very simple process. He used to have the sessions of chanting, dancing and after the chanting and dancing, a massive distribution of Krishna prasadam, Jagannatha prasadam. And after taking Jagannatha prasadam starts another session of chanting and dancing. And in this way there is a continuous festivity and by chanting one developed the understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and reestablishes his lost relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then the entire philosophy actually became revealed in the heart.
    
    This philosophy, the spiritual philosophy cannot be understood by mere studying of books. Cannot be understood just by some intellectual pursuit. This is revealed in the heart. When one receives the mercy of the Lord, this understanding is revealed in the heart, and that is the process that Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu gave. And that’s why Mahaprabhu Himself did not write any books. He simply presented his entire philosophy in 8 simple verses, 8 shlokas – sikshastakam. Yet, Mahaprabhu’s followers, they wrote volumes of books establishing the supremacy of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s teachings. So that is how wonderful Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s mercy is.  So today I will end here and I will invite questions.
    
    Q. Why the Buddhists accepted the teachings of Sankaracharya.
    
    A. it is not that they accepted, but people those days were fairly honest and when they were defeated, they accepted the concept. Because they saw that the other person what he is presenting is superior to their understanding. So they had to accept. They are not so thick skinned like the people of today – even if they are defeated, beaten to the pulp, still they do not want to surrender. But those days people were pretty honest, I would say, especially on the spiritual sphere. When they would have arguments, they would have discussions, whoever was defeated would have to accept the winner’s concept, because he knew, he accepted that “Well, you have the understanding better than mine. I will accept your understanding. And not that he was defeating everybody. Sankaracharya was actually defeating the Buddhist leaders, and when the leaders were defeated, their followers also accepted the defeat and followed Sankaracharya, and it is not that always they accepted their defeat and submitted themselves to Sankaracharya. Sankaracharya, you see, is Lord Shiva, and Lord Shiva has a good number of followers who are ghosts, hobgoblins, bhutas, pretas and pisacas. So with those he created an army. They are known as nagas. They go about naked and they carry a trident. So when somebody did not accept the defeat in a gentlemanly way, they were beaten up and driven out. So this is how Sankaracharya drove Buddhism out of India. (laughter)
    
    Q. Why were the kshatriyas more focused on Buddhism and the Vaishyas on Jainism?
    
    A. yeah. You see, that trend actually started with king Ashoka. You see, king Ashoka was the king of Magadha, the present day Bihar in India. He had a battle with the king of Kalinga, Orissa, and so many people died in that battle. He was quite tired of this battle. So many people died, and one night he saw a Buddhist monk, with a torch in his hand, he was going out and treating the wounded soldiers in the battlefield. So he was impressed. Then he started to speak to him and he became exposed to the teachings of Lord Buddha and then he decided not to fight any more. You see, so he became non-violent. Kshatriyas… this was another setback in the Vedic culture, because the Kshatriyas should never be non-violent. Kshatriyas have to be violent. If the Kshatriyas become non-violent, then who will give protection? So, due to that trend, the kings of India, the kshatriyas of India started to follow Ashoka’s example and they became non-violent, they became Buddhists. Prior to that India was a very, very powerful country. We can consider the history of India. Although there have been many, many attacks on this land from different other parts of the world, from different corners, from different borders, but never ever had any invader succeeded in entering into India, because right at the border they had been defeated and driven out. But after the ksatriyas started to become Buddhists, there were no powerful kshatriyas to protect the country. And then due to the influence of Kali the kings started to fight among themselves internally and then only the foreign invaders could enter into India. The first invader who succeeded in entering into India was only 1100 years ago. Prior to that, no invader could ever enter into India. In the history of India we see that there was no invader who succeeded in entering into India. On the other hand, the Indian kings, the kings of India were actually ruling over the entire Earth planet. King Parikshit was ruling over the entire Earth planet. And how would they do that? Like other kings in other parts of the world were subservient to them, subordinate to them. They accepted him as the monarch. And that is how the Indian kings were ruling over the entire Earth planet. And actually every planet has one ruler. It is only in the Kali-yuga that that system breaks down. First they became many, many rulers. They don’t want to accept the authority of one supreme powerful personality on this planet, and then gradually it ends up in democracy and communism. And then you find all third class people become elected as the State premiers and they pave the way to hell for everyone.
    
    Q. Why the Vaisyas became Jains?
    
    A. You see, generally the Kshatriyas were becoming Buddhists, and many of the Vaisyas were having their animosity or grudges against the Kshatriyas. They didn’t follow Buddha, so they found a counter-culture. That was Jainism and they followed that. Basically when we see the teachings, both are similar. Both are talking about non-violence. But Jainism, Jains are just an imitation thing. But Buddhism, because it was started by the Lord Himself, it has some genuine religion in it. Like as Prabhupada said, indirectly by following Lord Buddha they became devotees. Indirectly, not directly they became the devotees of the Lord, but indirectly – they were devotees of Buddha and Buddha is the Lord. Therefore, indirectly they became devotees of the Lord. And it is only a matter of time before they were converted into devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yes, Phalguna ?
    
    Q. Your class is very good and very short, Maharaja. Ramanujacharya established Vaishnavism, and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is also a Vaishnava. Was there any gap in between or….
    
    A. There was a gradual development. You see, there were 4 sampradayas – Brahma, Rudra, Sri and Kumara. These are the 4 bona-fide Vaishnava sampradayas. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu actually, although He accepted initiation in Brahma Madhva sampradaya, but He actually accepted 2 principles from each of these 4 sampradayas and that is how He established the Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Now that is one similarity that Mahaprabhu established, but ultimately we will find a difference. And the difference is all other 4 sampradayas’ process of devotion is Vaidhi Bhakti, whereas Chaitanya Mahaprabhu established Raga bhakti or Raganuga Bhakti. And the destination of other sampradayas is Vaikuntha, but Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu opened the gate of Goloka Vrindavana. So, yes, there is a difference between those Vaishnava sampradayas and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s teachings, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s Gaudiya Vaishnavism. That is what I am trying to gradually establish, that in the spiritual realm, we are the most aristocratic community. We are the greatest spiritual aristocrats. But that should not make us arrogant. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said, the higher you go, the more humble you become. The tree, the more it becomes laden with fruits, the more it bends down. Similarly, in spiritual life, the more one makes spiritual advancement, the more one becomes enriched with spiritual qualities, the more humble he becomes. Yes, Lila Madhuri?
    
    Q. Unclear
    
    A. Yes, I have to consult it, I forgot. I’ll find out and give it to you. Actually when I was presenting it, I was thinking at the back of my mind, “My God! I have to brush it up.” Yes, mother Prasanta?
    
    Q. We already have our svarupa in the spiritual world.
    
    A. You see, when it comes to the point of svarupa, we can’t really delve into it, you know. Like yes, our svarupa is eternal, but what is our svarupa, we don’t know. As long as we are in the material platform we will not be able to really understand what out svarupa is. We will find it out only when we go back to the spiritual sky. And when we go back to the spiritual sky, then we will find that our svarupa is in Goloka Vrindavana or Goloka Navadwipa and it is not a matter of imagination that some deviant groups actually propagate, that one can imagine one’s svarupa. Is it a matter of our mental concoction, what our svarupa is? If our swarupa is nitya, then it is eternal, it is there. And as we cultivate spiritual process, sankirtana, gradually it will develop. But the fact of the matter is, when we attain, when we become elevated to the spiritual sky due to our becoming purified, then, even if we go to Vaikuntha, we will not be satisfied. Until and unless we go to Goloka Vrindavan or Goloka Navadwaip, we will not be satisfied. Even in the spiritual Dwaraka we will not be satisfied. Just like the residents of Vrindavana, when they see Krishna in Kurukshetra, they did not want to see Him in that way as a king and wearing all these royal robes and ornaments and armed with different weapons. They felt, “No. This is not the Krishna that we knew. Our Krishna is a cowherd boy. He wears a peacock feather, he has a flower garland. He wears a yellow silk dhoti. He tends the cows in the forest and plays flute.” And due to the dissatisfaction, they started to pull his chariot. Krishna was up in the chariot to return to Dwaraka after the solar eclipse. That is the time the residents of Vrindavana saw Him and they just started to pull the chariot, and that is the chariot festival. That is the mood of the followers of Lord Chaitanya. On one hand they are happy chanting the Holy Name of the Lord. They are just happy glorifying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But they are not going to compromise for anything less than Goloka Vrindavana. And ultimately that is the svarupa of Mahaprabhu’s followers. But again, one cannot rush into Goloka Vrindavana. One cannot force his way into Goloka Vrindavana.  That will happen by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When the Lord will desire, He will open the gate and we will find ourselves over there.  In course of our discussion, we will also describe how Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is actually opening the gate to Goloka Vrindavana. May be that is what we will discuss tomorrow. Yes?
    
    Q. In the 4 sampradayas, we have Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva, 4 Kumaras also appear in the list of the 12 Mahajanas in the 6th Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Laksmi is the founder of the Sri Sampradaya, the eternal consort of the Lord. Why her name doesn’t appear in the list of Mahajanas?
    
    A. Because she is the eternal consort of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. She is the personification of the pleasure potency of the Lord. So that is the reason. We follow the 12 mahajanas as exemplary. It is not that only the 12 Mahajanas are the Mahajanas. They are just classified as Mahajanas. But Lakshmi devi is the eternal consort of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In that way She is… Who can be a greater devotee than Her? Right. On a similar note one can question why Radharani isn’t there, as one of the 12 Mahajanas. Or why Subal, Shridama, Vasudama and the friends of Krishna are not one of the Mahajanas? Because they fall in another category altogether. So, that is why they haven’t been included. Because these Mahajanas, by their personal example, they are setting the standard of devotion. Yes?
    
    Q. What contribution did Madhvacarya have to the establishment of Vaishnavism?
    
    A. You see, Ramanujacharya established Visisthadvaitavada. And then Madhvacharya came and gave a tremendous thrust to the spreading of Vaishnavism with his extraordinary spiritual potency. What Ramanujacharya established, in its own way it is also complete, but Madhvacharya gave, in a way we can say more complete understanding. In Visisthadvaita vada, it is established that the spiritual reality is one but there is variety. But Madhvacharya defined that variety even more. The concept of duality, through Madhvacharya, became even more prominent. So that is one aspect, and another thing is that… like for example we can say that Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur spread Krishna consciousness. But Prabhupada came and gave a bigger thrust to his preaching. Similarly, Madhvacharya came and gave a bigger thrust into the works of Ramanujacharya, or, rather, establishing Vaishnavism. But Ramanujacharya gets a lot of credit because his mission was very difficult, because at that time India practically became impersonal, under the big wave of impersonalism but Ramanujacharya came and just fought against that and established the Vaishnava culture whereas Madhvacharya found that the field was quite created. Okay, it is already 5 past.
    
    Hare Krishna!
    
    All glories to Srila Prabhupada!

    Hare Krishna! Let me take the attendance first. We handed out some outlines of our study course. Some of you didn’t get. Who all didn’t get? So, what I’ll do is I will just leave them here. After the class you can please collect it from here. There will be three lessons.
    
    Lesson 1 was the first day’s course. Then lesson 2, that was yesterday’s. Yesterday I forgot to give it out. So yesterday’s outline is also here, and then today’s lesson
    
    3. So all 3 will be here. Please collect them after the class from here. I was also thinking of asking whether the way I am conducting it is alright or should I use the black board and make the points or we also have an over-head projector which we could use. Do you think that will be helpful or the way I am carrying on is alright? Yes, Krishna Prema Prabhu?
    
    Okay, Okay, very good point. I will do it from now on. The reason why I did not do that is because the last 3 days, from the beginning of creation to 500 years ago I just rushed through because I actually wanted to come to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, which is the turning point in the spiritual history, but from today we will do that. And today we got some simple points and I wanted to discuss those points.
    
    Like today, I wanted to discuss about the purpose of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s appearance and the teachings or the principal points or principal aspects of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s teachings. So, the purpose of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s appearance.  Who is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu? He is Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
    
    Now, previously we discussed why Krishna comes, why does Krishna incarnate? Krishna’s appearance on this planet or in the material nature is to re-establish spiritual law and order, which is known as dharma. So Krishna comes to establish dharma. So naturally, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, we have to conclude that He came to re-establish dharma. But re-establishing dharma in this age is a very difficult task, because this is actually the age of adharma. Krishna sanctioned a personality called Kali to rule over this age and to establish adharma. Why Krishna allowed that? That is another point, which may be part of our discussion which we will later touch on, but I won’t get into that now. The main purpose of Krishna’s coming in this age is to establish dharma. But by the divine arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this is the age of adharma.
    
    Therefore, Krishna had to come in a specific way and distribute some special mercy to counteract that adharma or this very, very difficult due to the influence of this age.  And that is why He came as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He came hiding His identity. He did not disclose His identity as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He appeared as a covered incarnation – pracchanna avatara, or it has been mentioned in the scriptures as channah kalau. In the age of Kali, He came covering His identity. And how did He cover His identity? He did not come as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He came as a devotee. And as a devotee, Krishna is telling everybody how to become a devotee and He
    
    is actually showing everybody how to become a devotee. That is a very special arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna.
    
    Actually it is very difficult to recognize Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu as Krishna. But those who recognize Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna are very fortunate. On one hand, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is hiding His identity. In spite of that, when one recognizes Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, then they receive some very special blessings, some very special mercy, and that mercy is a very easy way to go
    
    back to the spiritual sky. In Srimad Bhagavatam, it has been described that the reason why Parikshit Maharaja did not kill Kali was that Parikshit Maharaja considered that Kali is a very difficult age. It is very sinful, a very degraded age. But this age has one great advantage. On one hand, people will become very degraded, but at the same time people will have the access to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s mercy. People will have access to the
    
    sankirtan movement and just by chanting the Holy Name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one will be able to go back to the spiritual sky, and that is why He did not kill Kali. He felt that “OK, Kali is bad, Kali’s influence is bad, but in spite of that bad influence there will be some great opportunity. So that is the special mercy of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.  Sri Chitanya Mahaprabhu came to distribute Krishna prema, which is rare even for Lakshmi Devi, what to speak of Lord Shva, Lord Brahma and other exalted personalities.
    
    Now, on one hand, Krishna prema is very rare. It is extremely rare. Brahmara durlabha prema sabakare yace. This prema is rare even for Lord Brahma, even for Lord Siva. This is how rare it is. But Sri Chitanya Mahaprabhu made this Krishna prema available to anyone and everyone, irrespective of his qualification or eligibility.
    
    Now the question may arise that why is that? In Satya Yuga, people were so pure, in
    
    Tretra yuga people were so sincere, so willing for spiritual advancement, in Dwapara yuga people were so committed to serving Krishna. In those ages, people did not get this opportunity. Now how is it that people are so degraded in the age of Kali, but yet they are getting this special opportunity. Why is that? The answer to that is, the Supreme Prsonality of Godhead is the Spreme Fther and the Fther is naturally affectionate. And
    
    the father’s affection becomes most intense to the weakest child. Isn’t it?
    
    When one son is capable of taking care of himself, has a good job and everything, the father doesn’t really care so much about him. The second son is okay, he also has a nice job, running his business, making his money, successful, second son also the father doesn’t really care so much. Because the father sees that he doesn’t need my help so much. The third son, he is going to the university studying, and the father is giving him some help, but the father knows that he is also going to stand on his own legs. But
    
    the youngest son is not only a little child, but he is sick. What happens to him? The father stays up by his bedside, caring for him. So that is what has happened in this age of Kali.
    
    Since the living entities are completely unqualified, absolutely hopeless and completely miserable and afflicted, therefore Krishna’s mercy has come down to pick them up. And that is the mercy of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and that has been described in the
    
    Chaitanya Charitamrita, in the beginning, in the 4th verse of the first chapter of Adi lila. Anarpita carim cirat karunaya avatirnah kalau in order to distribute that which has never been distributed before in other incarnations, He has come in this age of Kali out of His own causeless mercy. In this very fallen age of Kali He has come to display His very, very special mercy. To distribute something that was anarpita, that was not given for a long, long time. How long? 4.32 billion years. On another day of Brahma He did. But then for one whole day of Brahma, that is, for 4.32 billion years He did not give that. Now He has come to give that. When Krishna comes and displays His Vrindavan pastimes once in a day of Brahma, in the 28th chatur yuga in Dwapara yuga in the following Kali yuga Krishna comes as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.
    
    So after such a long time He has come to distribute this very special spiritual mercy. Anarpita carim cirat karunaya avatirnah kalau samarpayitum unnatojjvala rasam sva bhakti sriyam. What is that?  unnatojjvala rasam sva bhakti sriyam. Sri means wealth. A very special wealth. An extremely rare wealth. And that wealth is the wealth of His bhakti. Sva bhakti sriyam – the wealth of His own devotion in the unnata ujjvala rasam – in the most elevated and most brilliant mellow. Why it is most elevated? Because out of the five mellows, like neutrality, friendship, parental and conjugal, conjugal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the highest. And in conjugal relationship, the
    
    most brilliant one, conjugal relationship can be of two types – Krishna’s relationship with the queens of Dwarika, who are His duly married wives.
    
    That is called svakiya relationship – relationship like that of a husband and wife. But in Vrindavana, it is parakiya. Krishna is not married to the gopis of Vrindavana. But He has a loving relationship with them – like a boyfriend and a girlfriend. So that is considered to be the topmost and most brilliant loving relationship. And Krishna actually came to give the living entities of the age of Kali an access to that region of Vrindavana in that mellow. So that is why it is sva bhakti sriyam. Samarpayitum unnatojjvala rasam sva bhakti sriyam. Harih purata sundara dyuti kadamba sandipitah. Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose complexion is like monsoon cloud, assumed the complexion of molten gold, and He is distributing it. Sada hrdaya kandare sphuratu vah saci nandanah. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead reside in our hearts. So this is the purpose of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s appearance. But this reason is considered to
    
    be the external reason. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu appeared to distribute Krishna consciousness in the mood of Vrindavana, in the mood of the gopis of Vrindavana. But that is the external, this sankirtan movement which gives us the access to that is the external reason. There is an internal reason also for Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s appearance. That has been explained in the two following verses in the same chapter of Chaitanya Charitamrita. In the fifth verse of the Adi Lila of Chaitanya Charitamrita it
    
    has been described how Radha and Krishna are one but They became separated in two different Forms in order to experience or enjoy a loving relationship and that loving relationship is experienced by the pleasure giving potency of Krishna and the personification of that pleasure giving potency of Krishna is Srimati Radharani. Radha Krsna pranaya vikrtir hladini saktir asmad ekatmanav api bhuvi pura deha bhedam gatau tau. In the past, they assumed two different forms. But caitanyakhyam prakatam adhuna
    
    tad dvayam caikyam aptam radha bhava dyuti suvalitam naumi krsna svarupam.
    
    But now, these two, Radha and Krishna, although they assumed different dehas, forms, they have become one. How they have become one? Krishna has assumed the complexion and the mood of Srimati Radharani. Assuming the complexion and the mood of Srimati Radharani, Krishna appeared, in the name of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, He has appeared now. Radha bhava dyuti suvalitam, naumi krsna svarupam. In the fifth verse, it has been established, the tattva has been established, the understanding of Radha
    
    and Krishna. Like Krishna is the energetic and Radha is the energy. In one sense energy and energetic are separate. But then again, energy and energetic are one.
    
    Establishing that, in the 6th verse, Krishna’s appearance as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has been explained the inner purpose of Krishna’s appearance as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and there are three different reasons why Krishna appeared as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And those three reasons are Sri radhaya pranaya mahima kidrso. Krishna wanted to understand the glory of Radharani’s love for Him. Sri radhaya pranaya mahima kidrso vanayaivasvadyo yena madhurima kidrso va madiyah. What kind of sweetness is there in Me that Radharani experiences by loving Me, through her love for Me? And saukyam casya mad anubhavato kidrso veti lobhat. By loving Me what kind of happiness she feels? Krishna became greedy. The word lobha means greed. Krishna became greedy to understand these three aspects. Therefore saci garbha sindhau harinduh tad bhavadhyah samajani saci garbha sindhau harinduh. Hari, Krishna, has been compared to the moon. Actually the moon appeared after churning of the milk ocean. Similarly, it has been
    
    described, by churning the ocean of Mother Saci’s womb, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu appeared. As if, by churning the ocean of Saci mata’s womb, the moon of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Gaurahari appeared. So this has been described in Chaitanya Charitamrta, the inner reason of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s appearance. Now the question may arise that Krishna is omniscient, so why Krishna could not understand these three things, because Krishna knows everything. But it has been pointed out that, “No. In order to understand the Love of Srimati Radharani as He desired here, He had to assume the mood of Srimati Radharani. He had to accept the mood of Srimati Radharani, and that is what Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is. Krishna in the mood of Srimati Radharani.  Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is more of Radha than Krishna. He is Krishna, but He is more of Radharani. His mood is like that of Radharani. He is trying to love Krishna in the same way as Radharani did, and by doing that He is experiencing, He is relishing the glory of
    
    Radharani’s love for Him. What kind of sweetness is there in Him that Radharani experiences through her love, and what kind of happiness does She enjoy by loving Him? So these are the reasons of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s appearance. So I will start a discussion on this particular aspect . Yes,
    
    Lila Madhuri?…
    
    (Inaudible) You will get it in this outline. It will get it printed out. Anyway, I will read here. First thing is, Krishna wanted to understand the glory of Radharani’s love. The second reason is the wonderful qualities in Him that She alone relishes through Her love, and the third reason is the happiness She feels when She realizes the sweetness of His love.
    
    Question Unclear
    
    Yes, He knows everything but to really understand how Radharani feels by loving Him, He had to assume the mood of Srimati Radharani. Or let us put it this way, “Krishna knows everything, but you see in love affairs, if He knows everything, the love will lose its charm. Therefore in Vrindavana, Krishna allows Yogamaya to make Him also forget that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And that is the prerogative of Vrindavana. And that’s why Vrindavana is compared to the Earth planet. In a way it is like Earth planet and the residents of Vrindavana are like human beings. Krishna is like a cowherd boy and in order to relish this supreme loving relationship, Krishna forgets that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotees of Krishna forget, the residents of Vrindavana forget who they are and they even forget that Krishna is God. So it is all due to the intense love, or, in order to experience that perfection of loving relationship, that arrangement has been made in Vrindavana and that’s why Vrindavana is so special right? There, Krishna is not the Supersoul, Krishna is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead, omnipotent He is, but the omniscient part He has left behind in Dwarika. And there you see, because of that, that loving relationship is so sweet and so intense. And that’s why Krishna does not know the love of Srimati Radharani. What is the glory
    
    of Her love? What is there in Him that She becomes attracted to in this way, and what kind of happiness she enjoys by loving Him. So, in order to properly understand that, He actually had to play the role of Srimati Radharani. He had to stand in Radharani’s shoes and feel it for Himself, and that’s why He came as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. I hope that I have been able to explain that clearly. The main point is that in order to experience
    
    that highest loving relationship, Krishna had to forget that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the residents of Vrindavana also had to forget that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But this is not a kind of forgetfulness out of ignorance, but rather this is a kind of forgetfulness or maya due to intense love. Just like when someone very close to us may get a big position but our dealings don’t really change
    
    with him because he has become a big person. Like the son may become the
    
    President of United States but the mother still treats him like her own little son right? So similarly, in love, we sometimes forget the position of that person. So in order to experience that love, Krishna had to create that situation through yogamaya. Now, therefore, in order to experience or understand the glory of Srimati Radharani’s love, Krishna actually had to assume the mood of Srimati Radharani and love Krishna the way She did, and by doing that He actually understands. Yes, Pankaja?
    
    Question Unclear
    
    Not manifest, but considered, you see, we have to understand that Parikshit Maharaja is a very exalted personality who had the understanding of the scriptures. So he knew that on one hand this age of Kali is a very degraded age but at the same time, this age of Kali has a great advantage that just by chanting the Holy Name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead one can go back to Godhead. So he considered the advantage of this age and that is why He allowed Kali to spread his influence. And we will see, that on one hand
    
    the world will become very, very degraded but at the same time the people will have an incredible good fortune of taking advantage of the Krishna consciousness movement and make spiritual advancement. But if He did, then the situation wouldn’t have become so degraded and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s mercy wouldn’t have come down. I mean, the situation in this age had to become completely hopeless in order to invoke Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s mercy. Yes, Krishna Prema prabhu?
    
    Question Unclear
    
    No, No. you see, it is Krishna in certain caturyuga there are 4 yugas.  There are 1000 chaturyugas in a day of Brahma. In the 28th Chatur yuga, in Dwapara Yuga Krishna comes Himself and in the following Kali Yuga, Krishna actually considers how to enable people to have access to Vrindavana and that’s why He comes as Krishna Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So that is the reason, why in this particular Kali yuga, Krishna Himself comes as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and He actually allows the living entities to go to Vrindavana, which is the topmost region of the spiritual sky. In other Kali yugas, the
    
    yuga dharma is there, Sankirtan is there, but they do not actually get an entry to Goloka Vrindavana. When they attain perfection, they attain Vaikuntha, not Vrindavana. So that is the special prerogative for this age.
    
    Yes, Phalgun? (34:13)
    
    Question Unclear
    
    Yes, the thing is that it is not that every Dwapara Yuga Krishna comes.  Krishna, the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the son of Nanda Maharaja, whose abode is Vrindavana, that Krishna, the origin of all incarnations, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He comes only once in a day of Brahma. Out of 1000 chatur yugas,Satya yuga, Treta yuga, Dwapara yuga and Kali yuga make one cycle. In this way there are 1000 such cycles in a day of Brahma. Now, in the 28th cycle, in Dwapara yuga Krishna comes.
    
    He comes only once in 1000 chatur yugas, not in every chatur yuga. But then when He comes in the following Kali yuga, He comes as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And yes, when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu comes, He makes the prediction, “In every town and village all over the world, the Krishna consciousness movement will spread.” And then, in order to fulfill that prediction, He sends Srila Prabhupada.
    
    Question Unclear
    
    If you can go a 1000 chatur yugas back, yes, you can. But our way of looking is not through what happened in the past, because that is completely beyond us. Can you imagine traveling we can’t even travel 24 or 42 minutes behind. It becomes difficult, so what to speak of 4.2 billion years back. We don’t even know where we were at that time. So, it will be difficult, but you see, our business is to see through the scriptures -
    
    sastra caksusa. And through the scriptures we see that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu
    
    made a prediction, that in every town and village all over the world Krishna  consciousness movement will spread. When Chaitanya Mahaprabhu makes a prediction, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, can it ever be possible that His prediction goes in vain? No. His prediction is bound to come true. So, it will happen. In every town and village all over the world, the Krishna consciousness movement will spread and we have to carry on with that conviction that it will happen. Whatever is the state of affairs in ISKCON today doesn’t matter. But it will happen. And whatever is happening in ISKCON today is the preparation to make it happen. The divine arrangement of the Lord to make it happen. Hare Krishna. Ok, yes?
    
    Question Unclear
    
    Ok. The yuga avataras in other ages are described as sweta, rakta, Krsna. Like sweta, appearing as sweta avatara, He teaches the process of meditation in satya yuga. As rakta, He teaches the process of performing sacrifice and as Krishna He teaches the process of worshiping the Deity.
    
    Question Unclear
    
    Well, the general description that has been given in the 11th canto is that He is described as Sweta avatara and He is also described as hamsa avatara.  Then, in Treta Yuga, He is rakta, His complexion is like reddish and He is described as yajnesh and another name. I forgot. and Krishna is the dwapara Yuga and the pita is the yellow complexion in the age of Kali. Yes, Amrita kanana?
    
    Question Unclear
    
    Just as the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself, just by His will His devotees also can expand in more than one form. So, one understanding is that one aspect of Brahma goes back to the spiritual sky or goes to another planet where Caitanya Mahaprabhu is performing His pastimes and Brahma remains as Brahma also. So, I’ll just briefly touch the next aspect of today’s outline. The teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu have been classified in five principal points. That teachings of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is that Krishna, the son of Nanda Maharaja, is the Supreme worshipable Lord, which actually means, according to Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, we are the worshipers of Krishna, the son of Nanda Maharaja, and then, He is specifying, His abode is Vrindavana. Krishna has His different aspects, like Krishna of Vrindavana, Krishna of Mathura, Krishna of Dwarika – Vrajendranandan Krishna, Mathuresh Krishna and Dwarakesh Krishna. So our business is with Vrajendranandan Krishna. And then, the
    
    next point, the third point is, the way the gopis worship Krishna, that is the highest form of worship. And Srimad Bhagavatam, the spotless Purana is the proof of this understanding. Whatever Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is teaching, the proof is Srimad Bhagavatam. It is not that Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is concocting something. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead; He can very well do that because whatever He does becomes the Absolute Truth. But still He is abiding by certain proof. He is leaving
    
    room for proof and that proof is Srimad Bhagavatam, the spotless Purana, Srimad Bhagavatam, and Prema or loving devotional service is the ultimate goal of life. So if we can remember these five points, we can become the true followers of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. So, just about 6-7 minutes for questions? Yes, prema.
    
    Question Unclear
    
    Hmm. Ok. Yes. You see, devotion is received by the mercy of a devotee. Now the devotion to Krishna. Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But to approach Krishna we have to approach Him through somebody, through some devotee, especially through some resident of Vrindavana. So, of all residents of Vrindavana, the gopis are the highest and of all the gopis,  Srimati Radharani is the highest. So since we are actually interested in devotion to Krishna, therefore we are extremely attracted to Srimati
    
    Radharani. Because our business is to get Prema Bhakti. Our business is not to just get Krishna. Our business is to get Krishna prema. And where can we get Krishna prema? We cannot get Krishna Prema from Krishna. We can get Krishna prema from someone who is in love with Krishna. So that’s why Srimati Radharani, Who is a reservoir of love for Krishna, is very, very attractive to us. We are extremely attracted to Srimati Radharani. So the point actually is, we are not attracted to Krishna, but we are attracted to
    
    Krishna bhakti. And the reservoir of that Krishna bhakti is Srimati Radharani. Therefore we are attracted to Srimati Radharani. And those who are attracted to Srimati Radharani are called Gaudiya Vaishnavas.
    
    Question Unclear
    
    How dharma is established? By chanting the holy name of the Lord. How does
    
    the Name appear? The Hare Krishna Mahamantra is given by Sri Caitanya
    
    Mahaprabhu. This is a very special gift. Generally before Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s appearance, before they had the Mahamantra, they used to chant Hari Haraye namah Krsna Yadavaya namah. Gopala Govinda Rama Sri Madhusudana. This is the mantra they used to chant. So when they do kirtan, most probably in other ages also. I am not 100% sure about it because I have to actually look into the scriptures and see if I can find it, the mantra of other Kali yugas. But one thing is that Mahamantra is given only in this Kali Yuga, and Mahamantra is synonymous to Krishna Prema. So in other ages if they did not get Krishna prema, then the Mahamantra was probably not distributed.
    
    Question Unclear
    
    You see, when Radha and Krishna are one that is Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.  Yes, when Radha and Krishna become one, that is Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is there eternally in Goloka Navadvipa. Goloka has two chambers – one side is Vrindavana and the other side is Navadvipa. In Vrindavana Radha and Krishna are enjoying their loving exchange and in Navadvipa they have become one and are distributing that love. So, yes, when Radha and Krishna become one that is Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.
    
    Question Unclear
    
    They recognized that this is Krishna, but they saw, they also felt that this Krishna is not the Krishna that they knew. This is not their Krishna.  This Krishna is not really the Krishna that they knew. Therefore they were not satisfied and that’s why they started to pull the chariot. And when Vasudeva Krishna goes to Vrindavana. because He is also hankering to be with His devotees of Vrindavana. Then Vasudeva Krishna assumed the form of  Jagannatha. His hands stretch forward, His face lights up with a beautiful
    
    smile and He becomes Jagannatha, wanting to embrace His devotees. Ok, last
    
    question?
    
    Question Unclear
    
    When we worship the Lord on the altar, then it is done with awe and reverence, with opulence. Yes, at home the altar is also there. Or is it something else? Yes, at home also. That’s why there is controversy why we put a peacock feather on Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s head. The thing is, although Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came as a devotee, when we worship on the altar, we don’t worship Him as a devotee, we worship Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Radha Krishna in united form, combined Form, and that’s why weworship Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead with all opulence and with awe and reverence. Okay, Hare Krishna, thank you all very much.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>Spiritual life begins with submission to the laws given by the Lord, which is known as religion. Religion means the laws given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We see that initially one abides by the laws of the Lord because he sees that by becoming religious he can have better material facilities. That is karma kanda. Enjoyment in the material nature is not the real object of spiritual life. Even liberation from material bondage is not the goal.

    These are just some secondary effects of spiritual life which have been described in the Vedas as dharma, artha, kama and moksha. In dharma, one leads a religious life. As a result of that he gets artha, material benefits. By getting material benefits, he can fulfill his desires, kama. And finally, when he sees that in spite of fulfilling all his desires he is not really getting what he is hankering for, he considers that the goal of life is to get out of the material world because it is filled with miseries. Moksha is the common understanding of spiritual life.
    
    When we approach Srimad Bhagavatam, we get an understanding of what actual spiritual life is. And from Chaitanya Charitamrita, we get an even deeper understanding that material desire, enjoyment in the material nature, and also aspiring for liberation from material bondage are detrimental to spiritual advancement. They are considered like two pots of poison. Material enjoyment as well as liberation are not the goal. The goal is to become elevated to the spiritual sky.
    
    In order to become elevated to the spiritual world, one has to become a devotee of the Lord. Unless and until one becomes a devotee of the Lord, one cannot go back to the spiritual world. That is the preliminary understanding. Then we find that there are different levels of elevation among the devotees, as we saw in the first part of Brhad Bhagavatmrta.
    
    These understandings are very important to become fully aware of our heritage: what we are following, what actually is Krishna consciousness movement? Is this just another religion or another fad? Many people have that misconception. Even I had. When I saw ISKCON devotees from a distance, I used to think they were just a bunch of American boys and girls who found a new fad: shaving their heads and wearing saffron, chanting Hare Krishna. When I joined ISKCON, many people thought the same way that why I am joining ISKCON? There are so many spiritual institutions in India, why I had to join this movement which is apparently an American thing? Those days, there were very few Indians in ISKCON, even in India, it was mostly Americans. That is the basic misconception about this movement.
    
    We should have the proper understanding of what this movement actually stands for. What are we actually pursuing ? Our conclusion should be that unless this is the best, we should not settle for this. Our approach should be that if there is anything better than ISKCON, then we should go there. If we are after some spiritual achievement, then isn’t it natural that we should go for the best ? Sometimes people settle for sentiment, “Oh, my grandfather was initiated by this group, so I should also go in this.” So many missions, so many spiritual organizations are gathering their following just on sentiment. They do not settle for any spiritual understanding; they just go for sentimental reasons. That should not be the case with us. If we are really intelligent, if we are really serious about our spiritual life, then our attitude should be that we go for the best.
    
    If there is anything better than ISKCON, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement, then yes, we should go for that. I can say that yes, I will go there, but in the last twenty-three years I have not found anything better. On the other hand, the more I am probing inside this philosophy and the spiritual understanding, and even our inner feelings and realizations, I am becoming more and more convinced that this is the best. That is why I can announce that if there is anything better, we are ready to accept because we know that there is nothing better than this.
    
    Now here, through this discussion of the history of our Vaishnava heritage, this is what we are trying to establish. What Chaitanya Mahaprabhu  gave is the highest. It is not a sentimental claim, but the verdict of the scriptures. Also, when we want to analyze it and verify it, then we get to see that this is the highest spiritual achievement. A part of it we discussed yesterday, that who is the greatest devotee, what is the highest form of devotion? Narada Muni is very systematically experiencing that. Sanatana Goswami is describing Narada Muni’s search for the greatest devotee. We are seeing the gradual elevation of one’s devotional profoundity.
    
    Today we will be discussing the second part of Brhad Bhagavatamrta. The second part of Brhad Bhagavatmrita is actually describing a devotee’s journey back to Godhead. The story begins with a cowherd boy named Gopakumara. Gopakumar is born in Govardhana in a family of Vaishyas, a cowherd family. Like other cowherd boys, Gopakumar used to tend the cows in the forest of Vrindavana.
    
    Gopakumar used to see one person who was very strange. He used to behave like a madman. Sometimes they would see him laughing, sometimes crying, sometimes rolling on the ground. In this way, this person was behaving like a mad man, but this person was very affectionate towards these cowherd boys. When he would see them, he would pour out the affection of his heart on them. And the cowherd boys were also very affectionate towards him. They would offer the milk of the cows. In this way, he had a very nice relationship with the cowherd boys.
    
    One day, when Gopakumar was alone, he came across this person on the bank of Yamuna. That person told him to go take a bath in Yamuna and he would give him a mantra. He gave him the ten-syllable Gopal Mantra. He told him that this mantra is very powerful, a very precious spiritual wealth. He asked Gopakumar to cultivate it very carefully and keep it protected with a lot of care and attention. After that he fainted.
    
    Since Gopakumar received this mantra and he was told that this was the most precious mantra, he started to chant the mantra. Gopakumar lost interest in everything else. All he wanted to do was chant. He felt that everything else is just a hindrance. His friends, his family, his duty to tend the cows in the forest, he felt they were all a hindrance to his meditating on the mantra.
    
    One day, Gopakumar decided to leave his place in Vrindavana. He just left and started to wander alone. He would find some solitary place and just chant the mantra. He was deriving great joy from doing that. One day, he came to prayag, the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna. We have to understand that Gopakumar was traveling along the Yamuna river and in this way, he came to Prayag.
    
    In Prayag, he saw one Brahmin worshiping the Salagrama Sila. So, Gopakumar became curious and asked the Brahmin what he was doing. The Brahmin told him, “I am worshiping Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Gopakumar was very thrilled to see that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Whose mantra he is chanting, here is that Personality. He became very excited.
    
    The brahmana put the salagrama sila in a small box and closed the box. When he did that, Gopakumar started to cry. He said, “See, he put the Supreme Personality of Godhead in such a small box. What will He do if He feels hungry or wants something? No one will be able to hear Him.”
    
    When the brahmana saw Gopakumar crying like that, he said, “My boy, I am just a poor brahmana, I cannot afford a very gorgeous worship of the Lord. Therefore, this is how I have to worship and carry Him. If you really want to see some grand worship of the Lord, go to such and such place. You will see that the King there is really worshiping the Lord with so much grandeur.”
    
    Gopakumar went there and saw the Lord was really being worshiped in such a gorgeous temple. He was very, very happy to be there. He was happily spending his time living in the temple, associating with the Lord, chanting His name. At night, he would just sleep in one corner of the temple.
    
    One day, the king of that kingdom died and he did not have any successor for the throne. The ministers started to look for a suitable person to ascend to the throne. They found in the person of Gopakumar all the signs of a king. They made him the king. Although Gopakumar became the king, he was not interested in anything but promoting the Lord’s service and worship. All his time was dedicated in serving the Lord.
    
    Still, Gopakumar would feel bad when people would waste the Mahaprasad of the Lord and consider it stale or old and not take the Prasad. When Gopakumar became morose about that attitude of the people there, then Gopakumar got to know that in Nilachala on the bank of the salt water ocean in the East, there is a temple of Lord Niladripati, Lord Jagannatha. There, no one considers the Lord’s Prasadam stale or rotten. They always consider the Prasadam of Lord Jagannatha as spiritual. They would carry the Prasadam to a distant place and honor the Prasadam.
    
    In this way, Gopakumar became interested in Jagannatha Puri. He left his kingdom and went there. Gopakumar started to live very happily in the presence of Lord Jagannatha. He saw that Jagannatha’s Prasadam was considered to be non-different from the Lord Himself. There also, when the king died, the king’s son did not want to assume the responsibility of the king. Therefore, they made Gopakumar the king. Gopakumar started to take care of Lord Jagannatha’s service.
    
    One day, Gopakumar was feeling very bad about Vrindavana. Then, Lord Jagannatha appeared to him in a dream and told him, “This place and Mathura are non-different. The Lord there is also non-different than Me, so why don’t you go back to Vrindavana ?” In Vrindavana, he used to just live in the forest, chanting, and from time to time, he would have the darshan of the Lord. In this way, he was spending his time.
    
    Around that time, he got to know about the grand worship of the Lord as it was performed by Indra. Gopakumar desired to see how Indra worshiped the Lord.
    
    We notice that whatever Gopakumar desired, by the potency of this mantra, he would get that. That mantra, just like a desire tree, fulfills the desire of one who chants. Therefore, one should be very careful what he desires when he chants this mantra because if one has material desires, watch out! Krishna will fulfill those desires. Gopakumar’s desire was always spiritual.
    
    Gopakumar desired to go to the heavenly planets and he was elevated there. There, after a while, Indra ran away from swarga loka because he was afraid of being cursed by a Brahmin. The throne of heaven was empty, so Brhaspati advised that Gopakumar be named the king. So Gopakumar got the position of Indra. Although Gopakumar became the king of heaven, he was not at all interested in any kind of sense gratification. In G’s nature we see that he was not attracted to sense gratification or to women and he was free from all anarthas. That is the sign of a sincere devotee.
    
    Then, one day some very powerful personalities came to the heavenly planets. Gopakumar was very surprised to see them. They seemed to be as brilliant as the sun. Brhaspati told him that they are the sages from Maharloka, the place that is above swarga loka: Bhur, Bhuvas, Svar, and then, Maharloka. Gopakumar then wanted to go to Maharloka. He was elevated to Maharloka. There he was associating with the sages who were performing sacrifices. There, from the sacrificial fire, Lord Yogeshwara appears. In this way, Gopakumar saw the Lord in His Yogeshwara form. He was spending time in the association of very exalted personalities.
    
    Then Gopakumar got to know about Janaloka, where there are some even more powerful sages. He desired to go there, so he was elevated there. Then he was elevated to Tapoloka, then Satyaloka, the place of Lord Brahma. There, Gopakumar was spending his time in the association of exalted personalities.
    
    Once, Lord Brahma left Satyaloka, so Gopakumar was made Brahma. Here also we see that the devotees are given these very exalted positions and devotees do not refuse them, but they accept with a mood of service. They see that by assuming these positions, they can execute more service to the Lord.
    
    There, Gopakumar met his spiritual master. His spiritual master advised him to go back to Vrindavan and chant the Holy Name of the Lord. So Gopakumar came back to Vrindavan. He stayed in Brahma loka for such a long time that you can imagine what happened to the Earth planet in such a time. He saw that the Earth planet had changed so much in that time. It was not at all like what he saw it last time. Although the entire Earth planet had changed, Vrindavan was still the same. This way, we get to know that time doesn’t affect Vrindavan and Mayapur, they are the spiritual abode of the Lord. They always remain the same. May be on the surface there are some cosmetic differences, but the places are the same.
    
    Although Vrindavan was the same, none of his old friends or acquaintances were there. Not that Gopakumar actually cared for that, he was not at all interested, but still, he noticed that none of those people from before were there. There, Gopakumar started to chant the mantra.
    
    One day, he found himself traveling in a very fast moving vehicle, a space ship. It was moving so fast that in a very short time, all the seven planetary systems, including Brahmaloka disappeared from his vision. The whole universe gradually disappeared from his vision. Then he came to the covering of the universe.
    
    The first covering is the covering of earth. This is the causal form of earth. This earth is the effectual earth, which is the causal earth. All that happens on the earth platform has already happened there. There, Mother Earth personified worships Varahadeva. The place was so opulent that it cannot be described. He spent some time there and saw the grand worship of Earth personified, the way she was worshiping Varahadeva. Then, he came to the water layer. There he saw water personified worshiping the Lord in His Mina incarnation. Then he came to the fire layer. There he was the Lord being worshipped as Vaishwanara. Then he went to the air layer, then mind. In the mind layer, Aniruddha was being worshipped. Then, in the false ego layer, Lord Sankarshana was being worshiped. Finally he came to the covering of the material nature herself. There, material nature personified was worshiping the Mohini Murti of the Lord, in the form that He enchanted Lord Shiva.
    
    At that point, material nature personified, Maya herself, was asking him why he was leaving. She was inviting him to stay and enjoy. Gopakumar addressed her as the sister of his worshipable Lord and begged her to help him approach her brother. Mahamaya is also Yogamaya and Yogamaya is Subhadra Devi. He begged her to help him approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
    
    In this way, he came out of the final layer, the covering of the material nature, and for the first time he became bewildered. He came to Brahma Jyoti. There he could not find the Lord. Previously, wherever he went, he could find the Lord being worshiped in some form or another, but here he could not find the Lord. Only there were some flashes of the Supersoul in that brilliant, blinding, glaring light of Brahmajyoti.
    
    He started to pray to Lord Jagannatha. All of a sudden, he heard the sound of Sankirtan. He saw a personality whose complexion was as white as camphor riding on a bull and he was surrounded by his devotees. He was coming down. He wondered who he was. He was told by one of the associates of Lord Shiva that it was Lord Shiva. He invited him to also join the party. But Gopakumar begged his forgiveness and went forward.
    
    Then Gopakumar came to the gate of Vaikuntha. At the gate he saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead with His four arms carrying the disc, lotus, mace and conch shell. When he saw Him, he immediately offered obeisances and started saying, “O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead.” But that person, as soon as he heard that, covered his ears and started saying, “I am not the Lord! I am not the Lord!” Saying that, he just covered his ears and ran inside. Then Gopakumar saw another personality in a spaceship and he just landed there.he thought him to be the Lord and started to offer prayers. That person also became very embarrassed and ran inside.
    
    Finally, some person took pity on Gopakumar and took him to see the Lord. But when he saw Narayana, Gopakumar was so overwhelmed with emotion that he fainted. Lakshmi Devi came down from the throne and nursed him like her own child and brought him back to his senses. In this way, Lakshmi Devi and Narayan showered their affection upon Gopakumar.
    
    So Gopakumar was staying in Vaikuntha, but still he was maintaining his cowherd boy identity. Some of the residents once told him, “You are in Vaikuntha. You should assume the Vaikuntha form now, the four armed swarupa of the Lord.” Gopakumar declined that proposal.
    
    Then Gopakumar got to know about Lord Ramachandra in Ayodhya. So Gopakumar went to Ayodhya and received a lot of mercy from Lord Ramachandra and Sita Devi. Then, by the mercy of Lord Ramachandra, he was elevated to Dwaraka. In Dwaraka, he was having the association of the Lord. The Lord was showering all of His affection on him.
    
    One day, Narada Muni detected that Gopakumar was still unhappy. He told him, “Gopakumar, you are in Dvaraka, having the association of the Lord, why is your heart still not fully satisfied?”
    
    Gopakumar told him that he knows that he is extremely fortunate to be having the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and he is receiving so much mercy not only from Him, but also from the queens. But his heart is hankering for a cowherd boy who wears a peacock feather and plays a flute on the bank of a river. His heart is somehow just drawn towards Him. So much so that even despite being in Dwaraka and having the association of the Lord, his heart is still discontent.
    
    Narada Muni then told him, “I can see that your attraction is actually for Krishna in Vrindavana, but to go to Vrindavana, you have to go back to Vrindavana on the Earth planet. There you have to chant the name of the Lord with all of your heart. That is called Sankirtana. You perform Sankirtana in Vrindavana and by doing that only you will have access to Goloka Vrindavana.”
    
    According to Narada Muni’s advice, Gopakumara went back to Vrindavana and there, he started to perform Sankirtana in the forest. He was alone and he used to chant, call out the Lord by His name with all the love of his heart: “He Mukunda, he Gopala, he Nandanandana!” While he would sing, all the trees and birds also would sing with him. That is how it became Sankirtana. The trees would not echo but literally sing. To a mundane ear it may appear that the trees were actually echoing his chanting.
    
    In this way, Gopakumar was spending his time in Vrindavana chanting the names of the Lord with all the love of his heart. Then, one day, he saw Krishna. As soon as he saw Krishna, he just ran to catch Him. He almost caught Him. He caught the end of His cloth, but Krishna moved swiftly from there and the cloth slipped from his hand. From there, Krishna went swiftly behind a bush and Gopakumar could not see Him. His feeling at that time was like a very poor man who all of a sudden received a lot of wealth and just after receiving it, lost that wealth. Gopakumar became so heartbroken that he fainted and his body rolled down into Yamuna.
    
    When Gopakumar came back to his senses, he found himself traveling in a spaceship at an incredible speed. He found himself in Vrindavana. When he arrived in Vrindavana, it was afternoon there. He found some young girls picking flowers and they were all speaking about Krishna, but when Gopakumar asked, “Where is Krishna?”, he did not get any answer.
    
    Then, one elderly person told him that Krishna has gone to the forest to tend the cows. He would be coming back soon. He saw that everyone was eagerly looking towards a certain direction. He looked at that direction and saw that in the horizon, the dust was flying. Then he heard the sound of laughter and the mooing of cows. Then he saw Krishna and Balarama are coming with the cowherd boys along with the cows.
    
    When Gopakumar saw Krishna, he just ran to meet Krishna. Krishna also saw Gopakumar and He also ran to meet with Gopakumar. when they met, they just embraced each other. Krishna, in a delirious way, started to tell him, “My dear friend, where have you been?” He was expressing how much He missed him. While speaking like that Krishna fainted and Gopakumar also fainted. When the cowherd girls saw Krishna fainting like that, they all started to cry. They felt that this must be one of Kamsa’s demons that Kamsa sent to harm Krishna.
    
    Balarama came running. Seeing Krishna’s condition, he could see what actually happened. So, he brought Gopakumar back to his senses and told Gopakumar to chant Krishna’s name to His ear. When Gopakumar started to chant Krishna’s name to His ear, then Krishna came back to His senses.
    
    Then Krishna invited Gopakumar to come along with Him to His house. So Gopakumar went with Krishna and Balarama. Just when they entered the house from the porch, Krishna bid all His friends good-bye and said, “I will see you all tomorrow morning.” Some of the boys went back to their house. Some of the boys did not even go back to their house, they just laid down under some tree with some animals from the forest like deer and peacocks, just waiting for the next morning when they would get to see Krishna again.
    
    In this way Sanatan Goswami describes how this cowherd boy Gopakumar went back to Goloka Vrindavana.
    
    Q. What is that mantra that can fulfill our desires?
    
    A. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare / Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. Mahaprabhu said, “prabhu kahe kahilam ei mahamantra yaha saba japo giya koriya nirbandha… iha hoite sarva siddhi hoibe tomar.” So Mahaprabhu said, “I gave you this mantra. Now you chant this mantra with full conviction.”
    
    Q. But wasn’t there a mantra that fulfilled Gopakumar ’s desires?
    
    A: But this is an even better mantra.
    
    Q. But what was that mantra?
    
    A: That mantra is dasakshara gopala mantra. Generally the mantras are not uttered in public. Actually, we have an eighteen-syllable mantra and a twelve-syllable Krishna mantra. The twelve-syllable mantra is called Krishna Gayatri and the eighteen syllable mantra is called Kama Gayatri. Above all the mantras is the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra. Nothing can match or equal the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra.
    
    Q. If the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra is the most powerful, why do we say it out loud and not the Gayatri?
    
    A. Because Mahaprabhu gave us the Maha-mantra and gave us the permission to chant loudly and give it to anybody. Whereas the Gayatri Mantra, by nature, is a secret. That is why it is better not to transgress the scriptural injunctions.
    
    Q. When Gopakumar went to Vrindavana, why wouldn’t anyone tell him where is Krishna?
    
    A. Because they are so absorbed in thoughts of Krishna that they did not have any external consciousness.
    
    Q. Was it because Gopakumar was a special personality that Krishna embraced him? You said yesterday that we should not expect Krishna to embrace us.
    
    A. When the living entity goes back, Krishna may embrace him or her, but that does not become their constant position with Krishna. Say, in the Rasa dance, Krishna does not dance the Rasa dance with everybody, only with the sakhis. The others only assist the sakhis with their dealings with Krishna. They do not aspire to assume their position. They are happy just being their maidservants. Even Nanda Maharaja or Mother Yasoda, it is not that anybody will assume that position, but they will become servants of Nanda Maharaja or Mother Yasoda, subordinate to them. That is how one enters into Vrindavana, by following a resident of Vrindavana. The residents of Vrindavana are those intimate devotees of Krishna. Krishna may give His embrace to a devotee sometimes but that does not give them that exclusive position.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>Today we will be discussing Visvanath Chakravarti Thakur’s Madhurya Kadambini. Madhurya means sweetness. Kadambini means trout. It refers to the shower of Krsna consciousness that is going to inundate the whole world. Visvanath Chakravarti Thakur explains the gradual elevation to the level of devotion, beginning with how devotion sprouts. Devotion begins with the faith in the process of devotional service. Shraddha or faith as defined in Chaitanya Charitammrita as the unflinching faith in the process of devotional service and to come to the realization that it is the perfection of religion. All activities are performed if we just render devotional service to Krsna. 




    He explains as how faith in this process begins. He concludes from the scriptures that bhakti is rendered unconditionally. Bhakti is not even achieved by yogic perfection or jnani. Bhakti arises due to the causeless mercy of a devotee. Most of us are here because of Srila Prabhupada. It is his causeless mercy that brought us to ISKCON. Therefore, the only reason or the way, a person can develop devotion is by the causeless mercy of devotees. We see that most of the devotees join because in some way or the other they came in contact with Srila Prabhupada’s books. Prabhupada’s mercy is being showered upon the whole world in the form of his books. Hence it is a very important service. One example is that in France there is an elderly old person who even in his wildest dream wouldn’t have thought that he would become a devotee. He was a retired person and had been a corporate executive. He purchased a copy of Bhagavad Gita As It Is and placed it in his shelf. He never bothered to read it ever since he bought it. One day, he developed some paralysis and was bed ridden for around 2 months. All he could do was sit back and read books. He happened to pick this Bhagavad Gita As It Is and started reading it. He felt that this Bhagavad Gita is not a fictitious story and lot of things in it made sense to him. He became curious to know more as he finished reading it. The back cover of book had the address of New Mayapur. He recuperated and the first thing he did was to travel all the way to New Mayapur (around 700Kms). He drove that distance and he coincidentally arrived on the day before Gaura Purnima. Although he was philosophically convinced, he didn’t have enough faith to accept the process. As he saw the festival of Janmastami and Guara Purnima, he was literally shedding tears of ecstasy. The ISKCON devotees there explained him about the financial situation of New Mayapur and he assured that to support them. He sold all of his properties and holdings and was willing to donate it to ISKCON. I advised him to give half of them to his children and the other half to ISKCON. He is a full time devotee and played a very significant role is reviving New Mayapur. This is the mercy of Srila Prabhupada. Who could have imagined a 62 year old retired company executive to join this movement? It is not easy for him to adjust with young devotees. A person of that age must have been set and his flexibility must have been reduced considerably. He not only moved into the temple but brought his mother along with him. His conviction is that she is going to die and let her so in the Krsna conscious environment.  I wonder often that it would be interesting if we could compile a book on how different devotees came to Krsna consciousness. 
    
    
    
    
    The seed of devotional creeper is planted in the field of heart unless it is not dry like a desert due to sinful activities. Prabhupada was so emphatic about giving up the sinful activities in order to become a devotee. Meat eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex are the four pillars on which the sin thrives on. One’s heart becomes fertile when one stops all these activities. It is like clearing off the unwanted elements in the field of heart. When the seed is sowed in the field of heart, one has to water it by chanting and hearing to make seed of devotion sprout. When the seedling sprouts, two limbs manifest namely, kleshagni and shuvada.  Klesha means suffering and gna means to kill. Shuvada means all auspiciousness. So, these two limbs manifest in the field in which the devotion has been planted and watered regularly. All the sufferings  due to material nature is destroyed and all auspiciousness becomes manifest in one’s heart.  
    
    
    
    
    There are five kinds of sufferings namely, aviddha, ashmita, dvesh, raag and avinivesh. The word klesha is also mentioned in Bhagavad Gita in the context of impersonalism. The people, who are attached to impersonalism, simply invite misery to themselves.  Aviddha means ignorance of the temporary nature of this material world. It is to consider the temporary thing to be eternal. This material nature is a reflection of the spiritual world. In monsoon period, the water accumulates and we see the reflection of the trees on the water. The reflection disappear the moment water dries up. Similarly, the material nature is a temporary manifestation of the spiritual reality. Ashmita means me and mine. It is to consider the senses to be the self and the sense perception to be real. The body is mistaken as me and belongings of the body as mine. Raag is attachment to the sense objects that are pleasing to our senses. Dvesh is aversion to suffering that is not pleasing to the senses. Avinivesh is attachment to the body and having the fear of death. 
    
    
    
    
    One who renders devotional service is free from these sufferings. Let us consider these aspects practically. Aviddha is completely absent as we have come to the realization that this material nature is temporary and our real goal is to go back to Godhead.  Ashmita has been considerably reduced although we had not completely got rid of that mentality. All of us have given up our attachment to our family, possession and fame to become devotees. The attachment we now have got a spiritual shape. Now we think that I am a servant of Krsna instead of I am the master of the material nature. Dvesh is the aversion to the sufferings. We initially used to be so much averse and anxious in dealing with difficult situations. Ever since we became devotees, we are completely detached. The devotees are neither afraid of death as they know that death is just a change of body. The only fear of a devotee is that he might not remember Krsna at the time of his death. Therefore his only prayer is to be always engaged in Krsna’s service. 
    
    
    
    
    Visvanath Chakravarthi explains the different stages of devotional service and the way one attains it. The first stage of devotional service is the stage where one is full of enthusiasm. It is compared to a child getting a new book. The child is so attached to it that it holds on to it all the time. The next stage is called intense and dilute stage. Sometimes he is very intensely inclined towards rendering devotional service and some other times he is not so inclined. Then comes the stage, where he is in conflict with himself. He is in duality whether or not to renounce the household life. On one hand, he feels that he must renounce and go to Vrindavan. On the other hand, he feels that he has to take care of so many subjects and also he could become a good devotee being a householder itself. The next stage is the stage of war with material sense objects. He realizes that in order to go to spiritual nature one must abstain from the objects of material nature. Hence he tries to conquer them. In that war, sometimes he is successful and some other times he falls down. The fifth stage is called the stage of inability to perform the prescribed duties. The difference between the fourth and fifth stage is that in the war with material nature one’s inability is to win over the sense objects where as in the other stage one’s inability is to make spiritual progress. The sixth stage is the stage to float in the facilities that have been bestowed on the devotee due to the recognition of his service. In Chaitanya Charitammrita, it has been mentioned that the growth of the main branch of the creeper can be inhibited by too many of its side branches. Therefore, it is very important that a devotee doesn’t indulge in the distinction, adoration and profit that he acquires in the path of devotional service. 
    
    
    
    
    He explains the different types of unwanted attachments (anarthas). They are dushkritatho (attachment due to sinful activities), shukrititho (attachment due to pious activities), aparaditho(attachment due to offenses) and bhaktitho (attachment due to devotional service). The first one is the attachment due to one’s sinful activities. The second one is attachment to the enjoyment in material nature instead of Krsna. One example is demigods. The demigods accept Krsna or Vishnu. But they do not want unflinching devotion to Krsna. They prefer heavenly enjoyment and they pray to Narayan to drive away the demons. Aparaditho is the attachment one develops due to offenses, one has previously committed. They are further categorized into two types- the offenses in serving the Lord and the offenses to the Holy Name. It has been mentioned that offenses in service of the Lord is expiable but the offense to the Holy Name is inexpiable. The most abominable offense is to commit sinful activities on the strength of Holy Name. Finally, bhaktitho is the attachment due to devotional service. A devotee is provided with the facilities to execute devotional service as he becomes recognized. Visvanath Chakravarti describes five ways to become free from these attachments. They are ekadesha vartini, bahudesha vartini, prayiti, purnam and atyantithi.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>I will briefly recount on the topic that we discussed yesterday. The only means to achieve devotion to Krsna is the mercy of a devotee. When one receives the seed of devotional service from a devotee and starts to water it, his field of heart becomes fertile. The four pillars of sinful activities (meat eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex) make the heart barren. Srila Prabhupada made it mandatory to follow the four regulative principles i.e., to give up these sinful activities. The seedling develops two tender leaves namely, kleshagni and shuvada. Kleshagni destroys all sins and bestows all auspiciousness. Visvanath Chakravarti points out that there are five kinds of sufferings –avidha (ignorance), ashmitha (bodily conception), raag (attachment to pleasing sense perception), dvesh (aversion to displeasing sense perception) and avinivesh (attachment to the object of sense gratification). One who takes to Krsna consciousness becomes free from these sufferings. As a result, one goes through different stages of devotion. They are the stage of enthusiasm, the intense and dilute, stage of conflict, stage of war with material objects, inability to perform prescribed duties and stage where a devotee floats in the facilities bestowed upon him. Finally, one attains the stage of anartha nivruthi.




    There are four anarthas and there are five ways to become free from these attachments namely, ekadesha vartini, bahudesha vartini, prayichi, purnam and atyantik. Ekadesha vartini means situated in one location. It is a partial anartha nivruthi. The major part of anarthas is taken care of when one ceases to commit offenses. The greatest offense is offense to the Holy Name and as soon as one is completely devoid of that offense one naturally comes to the stage of Namabhash.  This stage corresponds to liberation platform. In this stage, one has been freed from the attachment to the material nature. One progressively develops a love or taste to chant the Holy Name. The Bahudesha vartini is being situated in many places. In this stage, one becomes fixed in nishta.  In the matured stage of Bhajana kriya, anartha nivruthi is called Bahudesha vartini. This stage corresponds to stage where one is almost devoid of anarthas but not completely. This progressively develops into ruchi or taste of love for Krsna. In the stage of prayichi, one develops a spontaneous love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead and it is almost complete. Purna is the perfected stage of prayichi. The absolute perfection is achieved in atyantik, where one reaches the lotus feet of the Lord. These anartha nivruthi stages are all perfect and profoundly complete. 
    
    
    
    
    The devotional service is not achieved by the dint of our efforts. It is only through the mercy of a pure devotee that one gets the benediction of devotional service. So we just follow Vaidhi Bhakti. In the spiritual sky, every one aspires to become more humble than a blade of grass. The more one elevates the more one wants to be humble. This is the greatest difference between a materialist and a spiritualist. Material endeavor is for higher and higher position. A kanista adikari thinks that Krsna is the Lord and he is His servant. He doesn’t recognize His devotees. A madhyama adikari begins to recognize His devotees. In uttama adikari stage, one wants to become everyone’s servant. 
    
    
    
    
    Thank you all very much. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>Devotional service begins with shraddha.  The faith one develops in the process of devotional service is the beginning of spiritual journey. Sadhu-sanga or association of devotees develops the faith. Bhajana kriya is to render devotional service under the guidance of spiritual master. One is cleansed of his unwanted attachment (anartha nivruthi) as he begins to render devotional service. As a result one becomes fixed up in Krsna consciousness. This stage is called nishta. Nishta leads to ruchi or taste to chant the Holy Name. The seventh stage is called ashathi or attachment. The next stage is bhava or intense emotion for Krsna. Finally, it culminates at prema or spontaneous love. 




    Devotional seedling comes with two leaves kleshagni and shuvada. Klesha means sufferings and gna means killer or destroyer. Shuva means auspiciousness and da means giver. As soon as one takes to Krsna consciousness, he immediately feels two changes – all his sufferings have been eradicated and all auspiciousness have been bestowed upon him. Klesha is of five types- avidha, ashmita, dvesha, raag, avinivesh. Shuvada manifests in twelve ways – detachment from material nature, attachment to Krsna, favorable attitude to devotional service, mercy, forgiveness, truthfulness, simplicity, equanimity, fortitude, gratitude, respect and humility. These are the natural qualities that develop in a devotee. Bhajana kriya is the next development that manifests in a devotee. It is of two types –anishtitha (unsteadiness), nishtitha (steadiness). Anishtitha is of 6 types – false enthusiasm, sporadic endeavor, indecision, and combat with Maya, inability to follow the vows, enjoying the material facilities.  One who transcends these stages becomes fixed up in devotional service.
    
    
    
    
    Pure devotional service is free from the desires of sense gratification and the speculative knowledge. Devotional service is of two types – mixed and pure devotional service. Mixed devotional service is mixed with three things namely, desire for material enjoyment, liberation and attainment for mystic power. One who is free from all these contaminations and renders devotional service is called pure devotional service. One who accepts whatever is favorable to devotional service and rejects if other wise is considered to be a pure devotee. According to Srimad Bhagavatam, pure devotional service is rendering service with one’s body, mind and word for the pleasure of Krsna. Pure devotional service is of three types – sadhana bhakti (following the rules and regulations), bhava bhakti (spontaneous sentiment), prema bhakti (pure love for Krsna). Sadhana bhakti is of two types namely, vaidhi bhakti and raaganuga bhakti. Vaidhi bhakti is rendering devotional service following the injunctions of the scriptures. Raaganuga bhakti is rendering devotional service following the footsteps of one of the resident of Vrindavan. Sadhana bhakti is of 64 angas and nine of them are primary. Sravanam (hearing), kirtanam (chanting), smaranam (remembering), pada-sevanam(rendering service to the lotus feet of the Lord), archanam (deity worship), vandanam (offering obeisances), dasam (becoming servant of the Lord), sakyam (becoming friend of the Lord) and atma-nivedanam (offering oneself completely to the Lord). 
    
    
    
    
    Anartha nivruthi is to become completely cleansed of material contamination. Material contamination is of four types namely, contamination due to sinful activities, pious activities, offenses and material facilities achieved in the discharge of devotional service. The first two categories are in regard with material consideration while the last two are from the spiritual consideration. One who wants to acquire glory on the material platform namely, distinction, adoration and profit through devotional service are considered to be contaminated.
    
    
    
    
    The contamination arriving due to sinful activities fall into the five types of suffering previously mentioned. The contamination arriving due to pious activities are due to the attachment to the results of pious activities. It corresponds to karma kanda section. Contaminations due to the offenses are arising from the offenses to the Holy Name and service. 
    
    
    
    
    The contaminations can be removed in five ways – ekadesha vartini (localised), bahudesa vartini (many), prayichi (almost complete), purna (complete) and atyantithi (absolute). In ekadesha vartini, one anartha or contamination is taken care of. In bahudesa vartini many anarthas are taken care of. In prayichi, almost all of the anarthas are being taken care of and bhava manifests. In purna, one becomes completely cleansed of all contaminations and prema manifests. In atyantithi, one reaches the perfected stage and reaches the lotus feet of the Lord. One may not have become free from the clutches of material contamination and yet he is free from the influence of death. This is the sublime and powerful nature of devotional service. One who renders sincere devotional service is subjected to the mercy of Holy Name and by Its mercy one’s anarthas is considerably reduced. As a result, one develops a taste for devotional service. Prabhupada often pointed out that one who constantly chants the Holy Name will become pure devotee eventually. The sufferings of those devotees are not due to their previous sinful activities but due to the mercy of Lord Himself. The devotees become purified by going through these sufferings. The devotee considers these sufferings as the mercy of the Lord since they are abated by the Lord. 
    
    
    
    
    All glories to Srila Prabhupada. Thank you very much.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `<p>Madhurya Kadambini describes the gradual elevation of devotion. It begins with shraddha. The next stage is sadhu sanga followed by bhajana kriya. Anartha nivruthi and nishta are higher stages. Ruchi, ashathi and bhava are the following stages in the devotional service. Finally, it culminates at prema.  




    A devotee in whose heart the devotional seed has been planted is bound to receive two benedictions namely, kleshagni and shuvada. Kleshagni is termination of all sufferings due to material contamination and shuvada is all auspiciousness. Kleshagni is of five types- avidha, ashmita, raag, dvesh and avinivesh. Shuvada is of twelve types – detachment from material nature, attachment to devotional service, favorably disposed towards devotional service, mercy, forgiveness, truthfulness, simplicity, equanimity, fortitude, gratitude, respect and humility. Anishtitha or unsteadiness is of six aspects – false enthusiasm, sporadic endeavor, indecision, combat with Maya, inability to follow the vows and floating in the facilities that comes along with devotional service. 
    
    
    
    
    Devotional service is of two types – pure and mixed. Pure devotional service is of three types – sadhana bhakti, bhava bhakti and prema bhakti. Sadhana bhakti destroys all distresses and bestows all auspiciousness. Bhava bhakti makes one realize that liberation is insignificant compared to devotional service which is very rare. Prema bhakti gives transcendental joy and attracts Krsna.         
    
    
    
    
    The anarthas or contamination can be removed in five ways - ekadesha vartini, bahudesa vartini, prayichi, purna and atyantithi. Ekadesha vartini or localized removal of material contamination is due to the practice of bhajana kriya. In the stage of nishta, many anarthas are removed. When bhava manifests, the eradication of anarthas is general. Prema or pure love for Krsna removes all the anarthas and hence complete. As a living entity reaches the lotus feet of the Lord the eradication of anarthas is absolute. 
    
    
    
    
    There are five impediments to nishta or to become fixed up in devotional service. They are sleep, restless due to material attachment, spiritual indifference, sinful habits (anger, greed and pride) and taste for material enjoyment. The tendency to sleep is more while sravanam or hearing. One who is situated in nishta is free from these symptoms. In India, all the children have tasted sugarcane. One who has relished the taste of sugarcane cannot give it up easily. Similarly, anyone who has developed a taste for devotional service cannot renounce it easily. As a result, one who has developed a taste for devotional service becomes indifferent to the material enjoyment. He becomes fixed up and his sadhana becomes steady. 
    
    
    
    
    Nishta is of two types – direct devotion, indirect devotion. Direct devotion is steadiness towards the objects that are favorable to devotional service. Steadiness in bhakti itself has three aspects – bodily, vocal and mental. The gross body is used in the service and vocal refers to kirtan etc. Mental devotional service is remembering. Ether is a substance which is subtler and sound is produced out of ether. Ether is very close to the spiritual sky and hence vocal aspect of devotional service is a very important one. Sound is the best way to control our mind and hence there is so much emphasis on chanting the Holy Name of the Lord. The favorable activities for attainment of nishta are no desire of respect for oneself, giving respect to others, friendliness and mercy. Mahaprabhu gave attachment to the Holy Name, compassion for the living entities and service to the devotees. In this way we cover up to nishta. 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Ruchi is the next stage described by Vishvanath Chakravarti Thakur. The manifestation of ruchi is when the golden coin of bhakti shines effulgently by the fire of steady practice and being propelled by its own energy and becomes fixed up. Radharani’s complexion has been compared to molten gold. The word propelled is significant in this verse as when one develops taste for the Holy Name it becomes easy for a devotee to make advancement. A Brahmana boy studies scriptures with endeavor and as a result, learning thereafter becomes facile. The stage till nishta is accomplished with arduous endeavor. In this stage, a devotee has to be precautious about guarding himself against namaparadha or offenses to the Holy Name. If one can take care of namaparadha, his most of the impediments are cleared off.  One should always guard himself against the offenses especially from blaspheming the devotees. Ruchi is of two types – that which depends on excellence of the element, that which doesn’t depend on the excellence of the element. The first one means that appreciation of kirtan or any service when it is pleasingly delivered. For example, when a person without strong appetite invited for dinner will inquire about the menu. He might take the food depending on his appetite. On the other hand, a person who is really hungry will not care about the menu of the dinner and will take any thing that is offered to him. Similarly, if the ruchi or taste is not strong enough, one might or might not relish the devotional service depending on the excellence of the element delivered. In the higher stage, one develops an appetite for the Holy Name and relishes the devotional service irrespective of the excellence of the element. 
    
    
    
    
    Ashathi is the attraction for Krsna. When the taste for Bhajan reaches an extreme death and Krsna becomes the very object of the devotional activities, ashathi develops. Prabhupada often pointed out that the attraction between a young boy and girl is intense. In the course of rendering devotional service, one becomes intensely attached to Krsna and He alone becomes the object of love. Thus, the devotee doesn’t care for anything else but Krsna. At the stage of ashathi, the creeper of bhakti bears the clusters of buds which within no time become flowers at the stage of bhava and fruits at the stage of prema. Ashathi polishes the mirror of the heart to such a condition that the Lord becomes suddenly visible in one’s heart. One can become effortlessly fixed up on the Lord in this stage.

    Yesterday we dealt till ashathi. Ashathi is the attraction for Krsna. When the taste for Bhajan reaches an extreme death and Krsna becomes the very object of the devotional activities, ashathi develops. Prabhupada often pointed out that the attraction between a young boy and girl is intense. In the course of rendering devotional service, one becomes intensely attached to Krsna and He alone becomes the object of love. Thus, the devotee doesn’t care for anything else but Krsna. At the stage of ashathi, the creeper of bhakti bears the clusters of buds which within no time become flowers at the stage of bhava and fruits at the stage of prema. Ashathi polishes the mirror of the heart to such a condition that the Lord becomes suddenly visible in one’s heart. One can become effortlessly fixed up on the Lord in this stage. The acquaintances of the devotee will apologize for him seeing his condition – “He was all right before. But now his intelligence has become marred”. His unacquainted neighbor will conclude that he was an idiot by birth. The followers of Vedic rituals will consider him to be stupid. The admirers of impersonal Brahman will consider him to be under the spell of illusion. The followers of pious activities will say that he is fallen. The devotees will say that he has acquired a great fortune. The offenders will consider him to be pretending. The devotees far from these dualities having fallen into the celestial river of attachment to the Lord will continue in the same manner.
    
    
    
    
    The bhava is also known as rathi. Bhava is the manifestation of spiritual emotions. When ashathi achieves full maturity, inception of bhava begins. It is the immature stage of spiritual perfection. A flower is an immature fruit. Similarly, the bhava is the immature stage of prema. It is also the blossoming flower of the creeper of bhakti. Its outer luster is the quality of rarity and inner luster being the quality of considering liberation as insignificant. Rupa Goswami categorizes that there are six results of devotional service - termination of all sufferings, all auspiciousness, realizing the rarity of devotional service, to perceive liberation to be insignificant, experiencing transcendental bliss, it attracts even Krsna.  So here we can see that in this stage, the flower of bhava is so beautiful and fragrant that it attracts even Madhusudana. In this state of bhava, all the emotions of heart like clusters of sesame seeds liquefy into perfumed oil readily fit to smear all over the transcendental body of the Lord. The appearance of bhava makes even a candala as respected as Brahma. This is the glory of the devotional service. A devotee becomes indulged in the lotus feet of Krsna. A bumble bee is completely attracted by the lotus flower. At the time of obtaining a spiritual body suitable for eternal service, the indestructible soul enters that body and material body almost becomes lifeless. At this stage one begins to experience extreme possessiveness for Krsna. A devotee having obtained the precious jewel of bhava, hides these emotions from common public just as a miser hides his possessions. But others who see with distracted mind will see him as lunatic person. Bhava is of two types - one arising raaga bhakti and other arising from vaidhi bhakti. The first type of bhava arising from raaganuga bhakti, is greater in strength and natural feeling with the predominance of the feeling that the Lord is on an equal level. The distaste for seeing Lord as the almighty Lord in the mood of awe and reverence is very thick. The second type arising from vaidhi bhakti is lesser in strength and natural feeling, with the type of possessiveness mixed with the love as the almighty Lord. There are five types of devotees-santha, dasya, sakya, vatsalya and madurya. Bhava by its own energy causes the appearance of vibhava, anubhava and datichari. The dominating mood from these elements is called “saibhava” which by mixing with these elements produces santha, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and ujjala rasas. 
    
    
    
    
    Thank you very much. Hare Krsna.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML =`<p>Today we will be discussing the last chapter of Madhurya Kadambini. The last chapter is entitled as Prema. Prema means pure love. The word love is exclusively for Krsna. In the material nature, whatever is going on in the name of love is actually lust. The difference between love and lust has been nicely pointed out in Chaitanya Chariammrta. It is said that the desire to gratify our own senses is called lust while the desire to gratify Krsna’s senses is called love. Love is also defined as the heart’s (spirit soul’s) spontaneous craving to become united with Krsna. The ultimate goal of life is to attain this love for Krsna. In order to go back to spiritual sky we need only one qualification – develop our love for Krsna. When this love for Krsna becomes most purified, one becomes eligible to enter Vrindavan. From the creeper of bhakti which sprouts two leaves in the sadhana bhakti, now gives rise to petals in the form of anubhavas (the symptoms of ecstasy attached to the flower of bhava). This anubhavas are filled with devotional processes such as hearing and chanting which shine effulgently. The flower of bhava finally ripe into fruits of prema develops. The juice which comes from the fruits of prema is tested as the essential qualities of concentrated bliss and its outstanding nourishing property is its power to attract Krsna. At this stage, one is not aware of himself but of Krsna and His surroundings. Therefore, this is the perfected stage of Krsna consciousness. This is the difference between meditation and prema. In meditation, one’s focus is on one object namely, Krsna’s lotus feet or Krsna Himself. But, he is not conscious of Krsna’s surroundings. Sometimes there is an intense crave for obtaining the Lord like a hunger which cannot be satisfied even by eating the tastiest food day and night. Burning like a sun in anxiety he is soothed by the coolness of a thousand moons only by testing form, qualities and sweetness of the Lord. Simultaneously, this prema arising from his own appetite increases slightly and the devotee longs for direct contact with the Lord at every moment. The intensity of his longing for the Lord burns like conflagration and tears his body like sharp arrows. He considers his friends useless and his household becomes like a thorn forest. Food becomes distasteful and praise of other devotees is like biting of a snake. All the prescribed rituals become an unmanageable burden. Though he remains constantly awake, wakefulness is full of repentance. His body seems to be the target of chastisement for the Lord. His life is as lifeless as roasted grain. Prema assuming the form of tender kiss attracts Krsna and makes him appear before the devotee for a moment. At that time, all the senses of devotee becomes receptacles of all auspicious qualities of the Lord namely, His beauty, His fragrance, melody, youthfulness etc. Proper words are not adequate to describe the ocean of bliss experienced at that time. 




The Lord reveals His beauty to the devotee in this remarkable condition. On account of the sweetness of that beauty all the senses and mind take on that beauty and obstacles like trembling, shedding tears are generated.  The Lord then reveals His fragrance to console the devotee. The nostrils of the devotee receive the fragrance and again the devotee feels the bliss. The Lord reveals the sound of His flute and devotee faints again for the third time. The Lord then mercifully places His lotus feet, His hands and breast and the devotee experiences the youthfulness of the Lord. Lord places His lotus feet on those in the mood of servant and holds the devotee in the mood of friendship. The Lord wipes the tears of those who are in the mood of parental relationship and embraces the devotee who is in the mood of conjugal relationship.  The devotee takes on the qualities of Lord and faints for the fourth time. The Lord gives the taste with His own lips. This however is bestowed to only those devotees in the mood of conjugal relationship. The devotees take on the sense of taste and faints for the fifth time. All of the Lord’s qualities suddenly manifest themselves to the devotee’s senses. At that time, prema which understands the Lord increases to the extreme and creates affliction among other emotions like hundreds of waves among the ocean of bliss. The devotee is again anxious to see the Lord recovering after some moments. 




The same stage of prema is beautifully described by Sanatana Goswami in Brhad Bhagavatamrta. The boy Gopi Kumar sometimes had the darshan of Krsna and sometimes not. The devotee at that time would behold such beautiful form of Krsna and all his consciousness would be focused through his eye. The devotee burning in the separation of Krsna sometimes rolls on the ground, runs from here to there. The devotee at that time feels like having fallen into the hands of a cheater. Therefore, a devotee is unable to distinguish whether he is in bliss or anguish. In the spiritual platform, both enjoyment and suffering is blissful just like in material platform both enjoyment and suffering is miserable.

    Srimad Bhagavad-Gita 3.33 
    
    sadrisam ceshtate svasyah prakriter jnanavan api 
    
    prakritim yanti bhutani nigrahah kim karishyati 
    
    sadrisam — accordingly; ceshtate — tries; svasyah — by his own; prakriteh — modes of nature; jnana-van — learned; api — although; prakritim — nature; yanti — undergo; bhutani — all living entities; nigrahah — repression; kim — what; karishyati — can do. 
    
    Translation by His Divine Grace Srila Prabhupada Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone follows the nature he has acquired from the three modes. What can repression accomplish? 
    
    Purport by Srila Prabhupada Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of Krishna consciousness, he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14). Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of maya simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose as advanced in the science but inwardly or privately are completely under particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature, he is in bondage. Krishna consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties in terms of material existence. Therefore, without being fully in Krishna consciousness, one should not give up his occupational duties. No one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called yogi or transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be situated in one’s position and to try to attain Krishna consciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches of Krishna’s maya.om ajnana- timirandhasya jnananjana-salakaya caksur unmiltam yena tasmai sri-gurave namah In the third chapter Krishna is explaining the Karma Yoga to Arjuna. Karma Yoga means whatever one does he should offer the results of his actions to Krishna. As Krishna mentions yat karoshi yad asnasi yaj juhoshi dadasi yat yat tapasyasi kaunteya tat kurushva mad-arpanam (BG 9.27) Arjuna, whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever austerities you perform and whatever you do give in charity, you just do it, you just offer them to Me. Working for Krishna is the ultimate perfection of all our activities. Living entities are ( unclear). They have to act and the art of action is to act for Krishna. Sometimes people think that they are going to stop action and that is how they will become liberated from this bondage of the material nature. Specially the yogis try to do that. Yogis mean Ashtanga yogis. That process instructs that one should stop the action of the mind. The purpose of yoga is Yoga Citta Britti Nirodha. The yogis try to do that but that process is practically impossible for this age. But Krishna consciousness is the ultimate yoga system. Living entities are active and for a living entity to become inactive is very, very difficult. One may physically stop acting but it is impossible for him to stop the activities of the mind. Even to stop the activities of the body is so difficult for how long can one sit down at one place? Half an hour, one hour, two hours but then he has to get up and do something because not to act is against the nature of the living entity. What is natural for us is easy for us. Whatever is not natural for us is very difficult. And we cannot stop the activities of the body so what to speak of stopping the activities of the mind. Therefore when it came to controlling the mind, Arjuna just told Krishna – Krishna, it may be possible to control the wind but controlling the mind is not possible. It’s extremely difficult to control the mind. Now to stop the actvity of the mind is difficult. To stop the activity of the body is difficult. But to use the mind in thinking of Krishna, that is not difficult. To engage the body in serving Krishna is not difficult. Therefore this engagement of the mind and body and all ourfaculties in the service of Krishna or devotional service is very easy because it is natural for us. Therefore this bhakti yoga is the easiest 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    process. It is possible for anybody. Even a child can be engaged in the devotional service. Even a woman can become engaged on the devotional service. Even an old man can become engaged in devotional service. Even the householders can become engaged in the devotional service. The thing is, we simply, whatever we are doing, we have to do it for Krishna. Like we don’t have to stop doing anything but we simply have to learn how to do it for Krishna. We like to eat and in order to eat we have to cook food. So we prepare the food and after preparing the food, what we do? We offer it to Krishna. So we are cooking the food but for whom we are cooking? We are cooking for Krishna. And when you do that, that action of cooking becomes devotional service. Then after offering the food to Krishna, we can take the food, we can eat, honor the food as Krishna prasadam. So that eating then becomes devotional service. Then somebody has to work to earn money. Now it is actually everybody has to earn money to maintain his family. In order to maintain household one has to earn money. But if you make your house into a temple of Krishna then the earning money for maintaining that house become devotional service. How to make your house into a temple of Krishna? Just establish an altar of Krishna in one room, turn it into, make it into a temple and worship Krishna. Then your house becomes a temple. Then whatever you do for your house becomes devotional service. When you are earning money as a businessman or as a service holder and if you use that money in maintaining that household becomes the devotional service. Then in your family, your wife, you make her a devotee of Krishna. Your children, make them into devotees of Krishna. Then your family becomes devotee family. And then to maintain your family becomes the devotional service. So in this way any action that your render, that you perform becomes devotional service by doing it for Krishna. Jai Sri Sri Jagannath, Baladeva, Subhadra Maharani ki Jai! Jai Sri Sri Krishna Balaram ki Jai! Jai Sri Sri Gaur Nitai ki Jai! Gaur Premanande Hari Hari Bol! So that is what Krishna is advicing Arjuna. If somebody engages himself in serving Krishna, that is devotional service. Then whatever he does will become perfect. On the other hand if without devotional service if one tries to control his senses, that is not possible. So what will you do? Simply act for Krishna. Will you do that? *Devotees *: Yes*Guru Maharaja*: Ok, very good. And how to become a devotee of Krishna? Always sing the glory of Krishna. And how to sing the glory of Krishna? Simply chant Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare So this is how please make your life successful. Hare Krishna. Gaur Premanande Hari Hari Bol.

    So, Bhagavad Gita, Second Chapter, text nineteen. 
    
    ya enam vetti hantaramyas cainam manyate hatam 
    
    ubhau tau na vijanito nayam hanti na hanyate 
    
    SYNONYMS yah – anyone who; enam – this; vetti – knows; hantaram – the killer; yah- anyone who; ca – also; enam – this; manyate – thinks; hatam – killed; ubhau – both; tau – they; na – never; vijanitah – are in knowledge; na – never; ayam – this; hanti – kills; na – nor; hanyate – is killed. 
    
    TRANSLATION Neither he who thinks the living entity the slayer nor he who thinks it slain is in knowledge, for the self slays not nor is slain. 
    
    PURPORT When an embodied living entity is hurt by fatal weapons, it is to be known that the living entity within the body is not killed. The spirit soul is so small that it is impossible to kill him by any material weapon, as will be evident from subsequent verses. Nor is the living entity killable, because of his spiritual constitution. What is killed, or is supposed to be killed, is the body only. This, however, does not at all encourage killing of the body. The Vedic injunction is ma himsyat sarva bhutani: never commit violence to anyone. Nor does understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal slaughter. Killing the body of anyone without authority is abominable and is punishable by the law of the state as well as by the law of the Lord. Arjuna, however, is being engaged in killing for the principle of religion, and not whimsically. [End of Purport] 
    
    ya enam vetti hantaram yas cainam manyate hatam ubhau tau na vijanito nayam hanti na hanyate So, Arjuna at the battlefield of Kurukshetra refused to fight the battle. Just when the battle was about to begin both the armies were facing each other in the holy land of Kurukshetra. The conchshell was already blown. That means the war has already begun. And at that point Arjuna seeing that in the enemy line his intimate relatives and friends are standing as his enemies, he became so overwhelmed with compassion and emotion that he told Krishna that he couldn’t fight the battle. He saw his grandfather, Bhishma. He saw his guru, Dronacarya. He saw his friends, and uncles and cousins standing in the enemy line likeDuryodhana, Ashvatthama, Kripacarya, Shalva. They were all very, very closely related to each other. Arjuna was practically brought up at the lap of Bhishma and now he is standing against him. And this battle was so terrible and the battle was so fierce that it was a matter of either kill or getting killed. A warrior never thinks that he is going to get killed. He thinks that he is going to kill everybody. So Arjuna’s mood at that time and Arjuna’s feeling at that time was, that how could I possibly release arrows to kill these individuals who are so close to me. katham bhishmam aham sankhye dronam ca madhusudana ishubhih pratiyotsyami pujarhav ari-sudana [Bg. 2.4] Katham, how can I in this [unclear], in this war, ishubhih pratiyotsyami, release my arrows to Bhishma, dronam ca madhusudana, and Drona as well. Because they are pujarhav, they are my worshipable spiritual gurus, spiritual master and grandfather. Pujarhav ari-sudana, they are my worshipable lords and relatives. In this way Arjuna was giving many reasons and arguments why to fight this battle was not possible for him. But at the end Arjuna actually submitted to Krishna. He told Him that, “I don’t know what I should 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    do. I am accepting You as my spiritual master. So You please tell me what I should do. Please guide me.” At that point Krishna started to advise Arjuna. Prabhupada mentioned that Krishna did not say anything to Arjuna until Arjuna accepted Him as guru and submitted himself to Him. And when he did that then Krishna started to tell him. And what was the first thing that Krishna told him? Krishna told him that, “Look, you are lamenting over things that one should not lament about. Asocayan anvasocas tvam [Bg. 2.11] Yes, prajna-vadams va bhasase, you are speaking like prajna-vadams, speaking like a pandita, speaking like a wise man. You are speaking like a wise man but actually you don’t have any knowledge. You are lamenting over something that one shouldn’t lament about. And gatasun agatasums ca nanusocanti panditah. One who is really situated in knowledge doesn’t lament about something that is transient and perishable. And then Krishna started to explain to Arjuna the science of Bhagavad Gita. From verse…in this chapter, second chapter actually, Krishna started to advise Arjuna. Verse twelve onwards and today we are discussing about the nineteenth verse. In previous seven verses Krishna gaveenough information to Arjuna about the permanent nature of the soul and the transient, perishable nature of the body. So in this way Krishna is actually explaining to Arjuna the difference between matter and spirit. We are in a world of matter, material world. This is the world of matter and by nature matter is inert, dead matter. Matter is dead. Matter is inert. Matter is unconscious. Matter is devoid of life. But in this world of dead matter you see some living things. Why and how? That is what Krishna actually established. Like, the body is made of matter but it is due to the presence of the soul that the body made of dead matter is alive. This is the first thing that Bhagavad Gita is establishing or this science is establishing: to understand the difference between matter and spirit. This seat where I am sitting, asana, is inert matter. This table is inert. This microphone is inert. The wall is inert. But we all are living. What causes us to be alive? To understand that, we can consider that when someone dies, although his body maybe lying there, but we say, “He is gone.” He is gone. Although his lying there we say, “He is gone.” So who is that ‘he’? Whose departure from the body made the body become dead? To begin with it is a dead body. A body made of dead matter is a dead body but it is due to the presence of the soul that the body is alive, meaning the body becomes conscious. It is a very simple common sense matter but we fail to recognize this point until we come across scriptures like Bhagavad Gita and teachers like Srila Prabhupada. Many of us, especially those of you who are coming from India and you few who are from the West also must have read Bhagavad Gita before. I read about seven different Bhagavad Gitas before coming across Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita As It Is. I used to carry a Bhagavad Gita 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    with me and I used to read from Bhagavad Gita, take note from Bhagavad Gita and I used to think I am understanding so much from Bhagavad Gita. But when I came across Srila Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita I realized that I didn’t understand anything of Bhagavad Gita. In this respect I recall one incidence. One of Prabhupada’s first disciples was Brahmananda prabhu. Those days Prabhupada used to live at the back of twenty sixth Second Avenue in a small apartment. And in the front there was the ‘Matchless Gifts’. There Prabhupada used to give discourses on the Bhagavad Gita in the evening. So one day Brahmananda prabhu, who was a teacher, school teacher, was passing by and he saw this. And he got to know the Swami is here, he is giving these courses on Bhagavad Gita in the evening. So he wanted to meet the Swami, Srila Prabhupada. And he went to Srila Prabhupada. He had an appointment. Prabhupada was ready to see him. So when he went to Srila Prabhupada he tried to impress Srila Prabhupada by saying that he also read Bhagavad Gita and he had a Bhagavad Gita with him also. So Prabhupada was naturally impressed, but Prabhupada told him, “Okay,just open any page of the Bhagavad Gita”, that he was carrying. So he opened that page, just opened one page like that and Prabhupada said, “Read.” So he read and Prabhupada said, “Close the book.” He closed the book. Prabhupada said, “Tell me what you understood.” And Brahmananda realized that he didn’t understand anything! [laughter] And then Prabhupada explained that to understand Bhagavad Gita you need a bona fide teacher, a qualified teacher. A bona fide spiritual master. And that kind of bona fide spiritual masters are rare in this world, who really understand Bhagavad Gita. Srila Prabhupada is one such rare spiritual master and Srila Prabhupada came and he presented Bhagavad Gita As It Is. Why Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita is entitled as ‘Bhagavad Gita As It Is’? How many of you know? How many of you want to know? Okay! [Laughs] If you add ‘It Is’, Prabhupada explains ‘As It Is’ meaning the way Krishna gave it and the way Arjuna understood it. That is what makes Bhagavad Gita ‘As It Is’: the way Krishna spoke and the way Arjuna understood it. There are many Bhagavad Gitas. I remember in 1976 actually we took a survey. I was new in the movement. Tukarama prabhu while introducing me told I joined in 1976 and we were making a survey of Bhagavad Gita and we found that there were more than 250 translations of Bhagavad Gita. And we also noted that all those 250 Bhagavad Gitas put together did not make a single devotee of Krishna, whereas Srila Prabhupada’s one Bhagavad Gita As It Is was making thousands of devotees, now maybe hundreds of thousands of devotees all over the world. Not only hundreds of thousands, more than that, millions of devotees all over the world. That is the potency of Srila Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita. Most of the Bhagavad Gitas what they did was they took the words of Krishna but they gave their interpretation. Not the way Arjuna understood, they accepted the way Krishna spoke, but they did not 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    accept the way Arjuna understood it. They did their speculation. Oh, Krishna is this, Krishna is that. Bhagavad Gita means this and so on and so forth. But Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita is the authentic Bhagavad Gita, the bona fide Bhagavad Gita because it is presenting Arjuna’s understanding of this wisdom that is spoken by Krishna. Bhagavad Gita was given to Arjuna, it was for him to understand and act accordingly. And we in order to derive the specific benefit out of the Bhagavad Gita we have to follow that course, the way Arjuna understood. In Bhagavad Gita Mahatmya, in the glorification of Bhagavad Gita, describing the essence of Bhagavad Gita, it has been mentioned “sarvopanishado gavo”, all the Upanishads have been compared to a cow. Dogdha gopalanandana, and who gave the cow? Upanishad is a cow and the milker of that cow is Gopala Krishna, Krishna. And this cow gives the milk for the sake of the calf, Arjuna. Arjuna is the calf of this cow.And those who are really intelligent, those who are seriously concerned about their spiritual welfare they drink this milk of Bhagavad Gita. They drink this nectar of Bhagavad Gita. sarvopanishado gavo dogdha gopalanandana parthovatsa sudhirbhoktha dugdham gitamrtam mahat This dugdham Gita, Gita is a milk which is like amrtam. What is the characteristic of nectar? What is the specific quality of nectar? The Sanskrit word for nectar is ‘amrta’. Amrta means negation of death. Negation of death, meaning immortality. You read Bhagavad Gita you become immortal. You’ll achieve immortality. That is the real purpose of Bhagavad Gita. How? As you are reading now, Krishna is pointing out that the body is perishable. Body dies but the soul is immortal. The next verse you will see that point very clearly: na jayate mriyate va kadacin [Bg 2.20]. This spirit soul is never born nor will it ever die. Na jayate means it is never born. Mriyate va kadacin, nor will it ever die. Ajo nityah sasvato ‘yam purano na hanyate na hanyamane sarire. Even if the body is slain, even if the body is killed the soul cannot be killed. Soul may leave the body. In a certain condition when the body is severed by some weapon or body is burned by fire then the soul may leave the body and when the soul leaves the body, body dies but the soul never dies. And what is our real identity? Our actual identity is the body or the soul? [audience: soul] Very good! How many of you think that you are a spirit soul? Thank you. And the soul is immortal. How many of you accept that the soul is immortal? Thank you! So you are a spirit soul and the soul is immortal. Therefore you are…? [audience: immortal] So you reached your immortality? [audience: yes!] Right from the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita you reached immortality! [laughter] Dughdam gitamrtam mahat, this great, nectarian milk of the Bhagavad Gita gives us immortality. Drink it and become immortal. But how do you drink this nectar? Some things you drink with your mouth and some things else you drink with your ears. You drink this nectar of Bhagavad Gita through your ears and you will achieve 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    immortality. So in the second chapter that is what Krishna is doing, at the beginning of the second chapter. Krishna is reminding Arjuna and through Arjuna Krishna is actually reminding us. This is an important point to also consider through this analogy of the milk of the cow. Although the cow gives milk for the sake of the calf but the calf doesn’t drink all the milk. Those who have any experience with cows you know that if the calf drinks all the milk of the cow or if the calf drinks too much of the milk the calf becomes sick. So that means it’s nature’s arrangement that cow’s milk is meant for human beings. Cow gives the milk, of course the calf is the impetus for the milk ofthe cow, but it is meant for the human beings to drink. So similarly, Krishna gave Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna that the actual purpose of Bhagavad Gita is for human beings to drink it. Sudhi, sudhi. Wich people, with individuals drink this milk. Sudhi. Dhi means intelligence. And su means very advanced, very developed. Also it means very beautiful. So whose intelligence is advanced, whose intelligence is active and whose intelligence is beautiful, Bhagavad Gita is meant for them. It is meant for those individuals. It needs a certain degree of intelligence to actually understand and appreciate Bhagavad Gita, and when you begin to appreciate Bhagavad Gita we see what an inconceivable wealth of wisdom this Bhagavad Gita contains. Everything is there in Bhagavad Gita. At the beginning of Bhagavad Gita we are getting the understanding of the soul and our identities being spiritual. Before coming across Bhagavad Gita or before coming across Srila Prabhupada’s teachings how many of you considered that you are a spirit soul? Okay. And what was your understanding of spirit soul? Think about it very deeply. Did you really have a clear understanding of spirit soul? Before coming across Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita or Prabhupada’s teachings there was no clear understanding of who the soul is. Actually, I mean, I don’t know in America but I came across a very well educated, well set person from the European background, Christian background. He is the grandfather of one of our devotees and I was having a discussion with him. He was a High Court judge and I had a difficult time to make him understand that animals have souls. His belief was that animals don’t have souls and here he is a High Court judge. It took me about twenty minutes to make him understand what actually the soul is. So main thing is that he didn’t have any understanding about what the soul is, therefore, he just went along with the Christian concept: only human beings have souls, animals don’t have souls. So the reality is that wherever there is life, wherever there is consciousness, we have to conclude that there is a soul. Trees and plants, are they conscious? [Audience: yes] Therefore, they are living. Therefore, there is a spirit soul. The trees are borne and the trees will die at some point just as human beings. Animals are 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    conscious. You beat an animal it will cry. You attack an animal and it will defend itself. So this is how we can see that wherever there is consciousness we have to conclude that there is a spirit soul. Now the nature of the spirit soul…Yes, we may have accepted the existence of the spirit soul and the identity of the spirit soul, or the identity being spiritual, but there is no clear understanding of what a spirit soul is. Now let’s get a better understanding of the spirit soul. The spirit soul is what makes this body alive. Spirit soul is the source of consciousness. It is due to the presence of spirit soul that the body is alive. The body goes through so manywonderful changes the body performs so many wonderful activities. Like every single organ of this body is such a complex mechanism… like the kidney, a simple organ of this body. What does it do? It is filtering the blood. The blood in the course of circulation is becoming impure, contaminated and the kidney is purifying that. When it goes bad, then we have to go for dialysis and a huge complex machine but in the body it is naturally there without even us knowing about it. So this is the result of the presence of the soul. The soul is in the body and so many wonderful organs are functioning .The kidney, the liver, the lungs, the heart and on top of that the blood circulation, the respiratory system, nervous system, and the brain, like… simply due to the presence of the soul and that is our real identity. We are spirit soul. That is what we understand when we study the scriptures like Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita gives us a very basic understanding. First consideration is difference between the matter and spirit, the body and soul, and we begin to recognize that our actual identity is spiritual and that is immortal. The soul is immortal – we change the body. The departure of the soul from one body is called death and the acceptance of a new body by the soul is called birth. Birth is soul’s acceptance of a new body and death is the soul’s departure from the old body. And the period between, as long as the soul is in the body we call it life. Jai Sri Sri Pancatattava Ki Jai; Sri Krsna Caitanya Prabhu Nityananda Sri Advaita Gadhara Srivasadi Gaura Bhakta Vrinda So that is what so wonderfully has been explained. And then it goes to understanding Krishna. We understand the soul, we being spiritual, our identity being spiritual, we being spirit soul. And then we get to understand the difference between us and the supreme soul – Krishna. That also Krishna has done very wonderfully in the 4th chapter. In the second chapter Krishna has established the identity of spiritual entity called the Spirit soul. In the 3rd chapter Krishna gives the knowledge of Karma yoga – how to function. This arrangement from the time of creation has been designed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and there are different arrangements. There are demigods, there are living entities and the demigods are here to supply the 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    needs of the human beings and the human beings in return are supposed to react towards the demigods in certain ways like paying them tax in the form of sacrifices and so forth and then in the beginning of 4th chapter Krishna told Arjuna that I gave this knowledge first to Vivashvan – the Sun God imam vivasvate yogam proktavn aham avyayam, vivasvan manave praha then Sun God Vivasvan gave it to his son Manu manur iksvakave ‘bravit…then Manu gave it to his son Ikvasku. evam parampara-praptam imam rajarsayo viduh…in this way through a chain of disciplic succession of saintlykings, this knowledge was flowing, but in course of time it has become lost. sa kaleneha mahata yogo nastah parantapa. Then he says, sa evayam maya te ‘dya yogah proktah puratanah…now that whole yoga that I have spoken long time ago, I will give it to you, to re-establish this wisdom. Then Arjuna had a natural question because we have to understand the relationship between Arjuna and Krishna is that of cousins. Arjuna’s mother was Krishna’a aunt and Krishna’s father was Arjuna’s uncle. They were brother and sister. Vasudev and Kunti were brother and sister. So that way they were relatives – cousins. And they were of the same age. Therefore they had a very intimate relationship. So Arjuna naturally asked him, look Krishna you are born just the other day aparam? bhavato janma param janma param janma vivasvatah?…Vivasvan was born so long ago param? janma vivasvatah? katham etad vijnayam tvam dau proktavan iti. How can we understand you spoke this wisdom to Vivasvan because Vivasvan was born so many millions of years ago and you were born just the other day. How can I understand that you have spoken? Then Krishna told him bah?ni me vyat?t?ni janm?ni tava c?rjuna t?ny aham? veda sarv?n?i na tvam? vettha parantapa. Many many times both you and I have taken birth. But about those births, you do not remember anything whereas I remember everything. t?ny aham? veda sarv?n?i. Sarvani means all – about all those births, all those activities, of every single moment I remember everything and then Krishna says that actually I am unborn, I don’t need to take birth but still I take birth, not take birth, I appear by the arrangement of my internal potency – yoga maya. ajo ‘pi sann avyayam bhatanam isvaro ‘pi san prakritim svam adhisthaya sambhavamy atma-mayaya…atma mayayaya, my internal potency, sambhavani, not borne, sambhavami manifest by, and why Krishna comes that He explains – when there is a decline of religious principles and increase of irreligiosity, to establish the principle of dharma, principle of religion He comes. So in this way Krishna establishes the difference between us and Him. We should not think that Krishna is one of us, No, Krishna is the origin of all of us, Krishna is the source of all of us. So in this way in Upanishads example is given just like the sun and innumerable rays are coming out of the sun. Now each ray of the sun qualitatively is one with the sun but quantitatively they are different. It is a tiny little ray whereas the sun is an inconceivable 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    source of all the rays. We are tiny, we are minute but Krishna is absolute. Krishna is the absolute. But qualitatively we are same. Krishna is sachidananda, Krishna is spiritual, we are spiritual. Krishna is sac-cid-ananda. Krishna is eternal, full of knowledge, full of bliss. We are also eternal, full of bliss. But those qualities, the spiritual qualities of Krishna will be there in us only when we are connected with Him. When we become submissive to Krishna we become endowed with those qualities. But when we become separated fromKrishna we lose those qualities. An example has been given. Like, a spark is also fire. A spark is fire, isn’t it? But the spark is a tiny part, a tiny speck of fire. When the spark comes out of the fire then what happens? Yeah, it loses its fiery qualities. It’s extinguished and it falls on a heap of ash just next to the fire. And it becomes ash, losing its fiery qualities. Our condition is somewhat like that. We are spiritual but being separated from Krishna we lost our spiritual qualities and falling into matter we are now identifying ourselves with matter. We are thinking we are this body. The speck of fire that was a spark now it became ash, but it has the ability to be ignited. But for that it has to go back to the fire. Similarly when we reestablish our relationship with Krishna we resume our spiritual qualities. And Krishna consciousness means to establish our relationship with Krishna again. Now we are identifying ourselves with matter and as a result of that we are thinking we are the body and we are functioning according to the moves of the body, according the demands of the body and according to the cravings of the body. But when we reestablish our relationship with Krishna then we will regain our spiritual qualities again. Just as you take the speck of inflammable particle that used to be a spark at one time back to fire, what happens? Immediately it becomes fire. So that is what Krishna consciousness is. And how to reestablish our lost relationship with Krishna? By developing our loving relationship with Him. Love is the criteria. Love is the force. Love is the factor that unites us with Krishna and that love is called bhakti or devotional service. Devotional service, love, real love is expressed through service, through action. So if we love Krishna we have to express that love, because we are active elements. We all are active individuals. We have to act. So when we act in order to express our love for Krishna then we become reconnected, reunited with Him. So that is the simple teaching of Bhagavad Gita and all the Vedic scriptures. Thank you all very much! Hare Krishna! [applause] Thank you. Does anybody have any question or comment? Yes? Question: Maharaja, can you please explain the difference between Yoga maya, Atma maya and Daivi maya? BCS: Yes, actually Daivi maya,Yoga Maya and Atma maya is the same. Maya means energy of the Lord. And there are two types of energies in 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    that respect: external energy which is called Maha maya and internal energy of the Lord which is called Yoga maya or Atma maya or Daivi maya. Daivi hy esa guna-mayi [Bg 7.14]. So here it is Daivi because although indicating Maha maya but it is implying that this maya is Mine, therefore it is Daivi maya. Daivi means divine. But mayaactually is a potency of the Lord it also means the illusory effect of the Lord’s energy. In both the natures, in material and spiritual, the Lord’s energy is bewildering us. Like, in the material nature it is bewildering us and taking us away from Krishna, and imprisoning us into the material nature. Whereas in the spiritual nature Yoga maya is engaging us in Krishna’s service making the arrangements. That’s also a kind of illusion. Especially Yoga maya is in Vrindavana. In Vrindavana Yoga maya causes the living entities or devotees or residents of Vrindavana to forget that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But here also we can consider that this maya is of two types. Maya means illusion. Illusion means not to recognize an object as it is. That’s what illusion is. So in the material nature our illusion or forgetfulness is due to our ignorance. But in the spiritual nature the forgetfulness of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Yogamaya’s arrangement, or the effect of Yogamaya which is due to love. Forgetfulness due to love. One is, sometimes we forget due to our ignorance and sometimes we forget due to love. For example, the son became the state president. It’s not that the mother doesn’t know that her son is the state president but because of her love for him she doesn’t care that he is the state president. It is not important that he is the state president. If he comes home late she chastises him, “What were you doing so late?!” So this is the forgetfulness due to love. There were some questions? Yes? Question: You were explaining that this is Bhagavad Gita As It Is, or this way Krishna spoke the subject, right? And Vyasadeva is the one who compiled it [unclear]. So what Krishna said and what Arjuna understood did Vyasadeva explain that? BCS: Very good. You see, what Vyasadeva did, he just…these personalities like Vyasadeva they have an inconceivable memory. Like, you can consider a tape recorder. Their memory is like a first class tape recorder. Everything is recorded here. And they could repeat it anytime. So, after Krishna’s pastimes Vyasadeva got Ganesha to write. So Vyasadeva was just narrating what was happening and he wrote. Vyasadeva didn’t give any commentary, but the understanding comes from a qualified teacher. Vyasadeva wrote the book who is like a publisher. He printed the book and marketed the book. But you, just by buying the book from a bookshop cannot master the subject. So what’s your profession? [Audience member: engineer] You are an engineer. To become an engineer what you have to do? You go to an engineering college, you have to study the books according to the syllabus and then under the 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    guidance of a qualified teacher. So it is a qualified teacher who simplifies the knowledge from the book. So that is the business of a teacher. So here, Prabhupada, as a perfect teacher he explained theactual meaning of Bhagavad Gita the way Krishna spoke and the way Arjuna understood. I will tell you one thing. As I was telling about reading Bhagavad Gita, I was reading Bhagavad Gita and actually one inconceivable (?) thing I would kind of feel at that time, when I was reading second chapter I thought second chapter is THE Bhagavad Gita. Then I went to the first chapter I said, “Well, this is IT! Here is Prabhupada as a perfect teacher, he is explaining the actual meaning of Bhagavad Gita the way Krsna spoke and the way Arjuna understood. That’s way you will see, like why I will tell you one thing… as I was telling you about reading Bhagavad Gita. I was reading Bhagavad Gita and actually one confusing thing that I used to kind of feel at one time. When I as reading 2nd chapter, I felt 2nd chapter is the Bhagavad Gita then I went to the 3rd chapter, I felt this is it and then when I went to the 4th chapter I felt this is it. But Srila Prabhupada when he gave Bhagavad Gita, he gave the last instruction of Krishna in Bhagavad Gita as the first instruction. Recognize that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. Then only you will be able to understand Bhagavad Gita not otherwise. Now a qualified teacher or bonafide teacher like Prahupada only teaches like that. Because he has the total understanding that’s why he brings the last thing as the first for our clarity. Right. Yes you have a question. Yes Question you have spoken about knowledge and devotion. <inaudible>. In order to advance in knowledge Gurumaharaj: Very good point. Very good point. You see, material nature and spiritual nature function in different ways. In material nature you first know, you first learn and then you have it. Whereas in the spiritual world, you just become situated there and it automatically comes, right? For example, like in the material nature you have to perceive and then you have to conceive. Right. You see things, you know about it and then you retain it, in your mind in your intelligence in your brain. Whereas in spiritual nature you just practice devotional service and the knowledge automatically comes to your heart. Are you familiar with the expression – Divya Gyan Hrdya Prakasito…Do you come to Gurupuja in the temple, Prabhupada guru puja? Do you sing that song? Sri Guru Carana Padama… Do you know the line Divya Gyan Hrdya Prakasito : one line from that song is the transcendental knowledge is revealed in the heart. It is not retainedhere it is revealed in the heart. It also has been analyzed in this way that bhakti devi is the mother. Bhakti is the mother, and she has two sons, those two sons are gyana and vairagya – Knowledge and renunciation. So wherever the mother goes, the son will follow. So 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    wherever there is practice of bhakti there will be knowledge –transcendental knowledge and automatically natural detachment. It will automatically come. Right. Thank you. Hare Krishna Yes. <another question inaudible> Gurumaharaj: Very good point. That reminds me, recently, we were in Pennsylvania (at) a retreat, and there, one devotee presented a skit – kind of a drama, dramatically. The drama was about a conversation between twins in the womb of the mother. So the way he portrayed it, one girl was … two actors were sitting on two chairs crouched like they were in the womb and a girl was standing behind them with a piece of cloth which was covering them, and then she removed the thing partly showing that what’s going on. So one of the embryos is sleeping and the other one wakes him up. So he wakes up very agitated – let me sleep, I slept only for 20 hours today and then he goes back to sleep again. Then the other boy wakes him up again and he says look I have something very important to say. He says I heard that there is life after birth (GM laughs). And he says, and in that world there is light. So the other says, how it is possible, how can there be light. How can there be life after birth. This everything, just don’t think beyond this. This is everything and try to enjoy as much as possible (audience laughter). And then he continued, you know there we can eat with our mouth and we can walk with our feet. So he was speaking like that and the other boy, he was completely denied it – how is it possible? Is there anyway we can eat except the umbilical cord. And he said no really it can be …and so then in this way you know like it just goes on. So I thought it was brilliant. Now when we look at our situation form that context , don’t we see that our situation is like that. We are living in a world, …O then it goes into, another very important thing. He says do you know, we have a mother? He says how is it possible, have you ever seen her? (Audience laughter). He says I did not see her but I can feel her. Don’t you realize, don’t you feel that it is because of her that we are existing and then he says, Oh common there is no mother. He says, but we can see, she is all around us. Although we do not see her, but she is all around us and it is because of her that we are getting everything that we need. She is taking care of us in all respects. And … anyway so I thought of sharing. Like you know, I mean, It is so foolish actually, its so stupid to think that this world is everything and our existing here is everything. There is nothing beyond it. But for that to receive thoseinformations we need a bonafide teacher. We need Vaisnav teachings. Spiritual master means (unclear ) who himself has the knowledge and who can impart the knowledge to others. So Prabhupada has created so many bonafide spiritual masters all over the world who are distributing this knowledge and as a result of that the world will benefit. Ok. Thank you very much. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.

    Okay so then I will briefly discuss about the seventh chapter which is actually our  main… These next few days we will extensively discuss the other chapters of Bhagavadgita. Today as I mentioned, is just we discussed about the introduction and how one  comes to this platform of spiritual understanding, transcending material platform how one  comes to the spiritual platform. As an expert guide, Krishna knows how to guide different individuals according to his  situation, according to his propensities. Now in the seventh chapter, Krishna is actually  dealing with jnana and vijnana. Jnana means knowledge and vijnana means realised  knowledge. Now in order to understand jnana and vijnana, we have to actually understand another  concept. What is ajnana. So generally people think that jnana means knowledge, any  knowledge. But according to the Vedic understanding, knowledge about the material  nature is not knowledge. It’s ignorance, ajnana. Knowledge about material things is not knowledge, it’s ajnana, ignorance. And this  ignorance is tying us down to this region of darkness. Our attachment to this material  nature is due to our ignorance. Now to get deeper into it. Will it take us out of it? No, if  we go deeper into ignorance what will you get? By going deeper into ignorance will you  ever come to the platform of knowledge? No. Therefore the first consideration is , “Give  that up.” This is not what we want to deal with. Knowledge about the material nature is not important. What really matters is the knowledge about our real identity, the  knowledge about the soul to begin with. Krishna very systematically gave that knowledge at the beginning of Bhagavad-gita.  Krishna pointed out what is the characteristic of the soul. Soul is na jayate mriyate va  kadacin. The soul is never born, the soul will never die. The soul is not perishable. nainam chindanti sastrani 
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    The soul cannot be cut by any weapon. nainam dahati pavakah  The soul cannot be burnt by fire. na cainam na kledayanty apo  na sosayati marutah  The soul is not affected by any material condition. It cannot be cut. It cannot be burnt. It  cannot be drowned. It cannot be moistened. It cannot be dried. That is the nature of the  soul. Which means the soul is beyond this material nature. So the knowledge about the  soul and its spiritual identity is jnana. But the knowledge about the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the soul’s eternal  relationship with Him is vijnana. And understanding that everything will be known. (Note from Ramola: Sorry, not sure how to remove the page-lines above and the pageline below.) yasmin vijnate sarvam eva vijnatam bhavanti. Knowing this everything becomes known  and achieving this everything becomes achieved. So Krishna has pointed out at the  beginning of seventh chapter. Krishna is pointing out. mayy asakta-manah partha  yogam yunjan mad-asrayah  asamsayam samagram mam yatha jnasyasi tac chrnuThe Supreme Personality of Godhead said: “Now hear, O son of Prtha, how by practicing  yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full,  free from doubt.” “Listen to me, I will give you that knowledge”, that is what Krishna is telling. yogam  yunjan mad-asrayah. “Being connected to Me, mind attached to Me, being sheltered by  Me, taking shelter of Me, the way you will get to know Me without any doubt, listen to  that knowledge.” And then in the next verse Krishna is pointing out: jnanam te ‘ham sa-vijnanam idam vaksyamy asesatah yaj jnatva neha bhuyo ‘nyaj jnatavyam avasisyate Krishna is telling, “I shall now declare unto you in full this knowledge, both phenomenal  and numinous. This being known, nothing further shall remain for you to know.” So here we can see that Krishna is pointing out: jnanam te ‘ham sa-vijnanam – jnana and  vijnana. Prabhupada translated jnanam means phenomenal knowledge and vijnanam  means numinous knowledge. So the knowledge which is perfect and complete, that  knowledge I will give you. What is that knowledge? That knowledge is the knowledge  about the soul’s eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now  when one is situated in that knowledge, does he need to know anything else? No. Then he  is situated in perfect knowledge. But this knowledge is very rare. manusyanam saharesu kascid yatati siddhaye yatatam api siddhanam kascin mam vetti tattvatah Saharesu, out of thousands and thousands of manusyanam, human beings, rarely one  
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    aspires for spiritual perfection. kascid yatati siddhaye. And of those who achieve  perfection; not that everybody who aspires for spiritual perfection becomes perfect.  Maybe out of thousands of them, rarely one achieves that perfection. And among those  perfected ones, it is difficult to find one who is a devotee of Mine. “Know Me in truth.”  Know Me in truth, means, who can get to know Krishna? Krishna has pointed out  beforehand aktamam abhijanati that only a devotee can get to know Me. So when  Krishna says “Knows me in truth” meaning that He is talking about a devotee. So this is how rare it is to become a devotee of the Lord. This is how rare it is to achieve devotional  service to the Lord. If we consider just simply manusyanam saharesu. Not one thousand  but many, many thousands. Out of thousands of people rarely one aspires for spiritual  perfection. So let’s consider that out of ten thousand, one aspires for spiritual perfection.  And out of thousands of them, rarely one achieves perfection. Or let us say out of  thousand of such aspirants, one achieves perfection. So 1000 x 10 000 is ten million.  And then of those who have achieved perfection, rarely one becomes a devotee. So out of  ten million, one achieves spiritual perfection. So out of say hundred such people,  perfected ones, one becomes a devotee. So what did you get, out of one billion, one  becomes a devotee. What’s the population of this world? So that is how rare it is to  become a devotee of the Lord. But we are in a very special situation. Bhagavad-gita was spoken five thousand years ago,  but Krishna coming as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has created a very special situation.  That situation is that this devotional service has become quite easily available. Caitanya  Mahaprabhu distributed it to everybody. It’s available to everybody. That’s why it’s  become so easily available. But just receiving this doesn’t make us perfect. We have to properly practice the process.  So we have to recognise how rare an opportunity we have received. Now should you take  advantage of it or squander it? Naturally we want to take advantage of it. So please take  up this process with all sincerity. Now again I will make one point. Actually I was expecting a lot more questions because I am trying to make some points  clear to you. Now if I don’t hear questions I don’t know whether you understand me or  not. Am I making sense? (Devotees respond yes). Do you understand? Did you  understand everything that I said? Now if you didn’t understand then why didn’t you ask  questions? If there is something that I failed to clarify, then shouldn’t you have asked  questions? As I said, this is actually a matter of question and answer. We are here with a  specific purpose. This seminar has a very specific purpose. The purpose is to make you  understand something. What we are pursuing, what we are practicing, we are trying to  give you a clear understanding of that. Question: Is the knowledge of the material nature or material knowledge useless? What  about our various occupations/skills, which we use to earn our income? Answer: Yes. Now let me consider what is the difference between material and spiritual?  Do you know what is the difference between material and spiritual? Does material mean  here and spiritual means there? The difference between material and spiritual is a very  thin line. When we do something for ourselves, that’s material. When we do something  for Krishna that is spiritual. So knowledge also or occupational skills that you have, if  you use them for your sense gratification for your sake, yes, then its useless. It’s not  going to benefit you. It may bring you some money but it won’t really benefit you in the  
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    ultimate sense. But if you do it for Krishna, then it is spiritualised. And then, yes, it has a lot of value. So whatever skill you have, whatever ability you have, whatever resources  you have, make it a point to use it in Krishna’s service because that will be the ultimate  perfection of your life. Please try to remember that Krishna consciousness is not a part time business. It is not a  part time business that throughout the week I will do my own things and on Saturday I  will come to the temple and attend the Sunday feast; and I have done a lot! No, that is a  part time business. Okay, initially that is fine. If you are engaged in that way, initially that  is okay. But Krishna consciousness is a life long commitment. Krishna consciousness is a  twenty four hour business. If you really want to derive the benefit out of it, you have to  become a pure devotee. A pure devotee means that he is completely committed to  Krishna. It is not difficult. It is simple. You become Krishna’s, then whatever you do  becomes Krishna conscious. That’s as simple as that. Whatever you are doing, just do it  for Krishna. If you are running your business, run it for Krishna. If you are taking care of  your household then do it for Krishna. Consider that your house is Krishna’s temple.  Consider that your family is Krishna’s family. It is not your family and you take care of  your family members. Then you are taking care of Krishna’s devotees. Then whatever  you are doing is becoming spiritualised. Yes, then you go and work, earn money to  maintain your family. That you are going and working outside, will become Krishna  conscious activity. So they have certain utility, specially in today’s world. Today’s world actually is a very  demanding world. Because of massive industrialisation, the world has become very, very  complex. If you don’t learn the art of developing those skills, you will be considered to  be useless. If you do not know how to do certain things you won’t get a job. If you don’t  get a job, then you won’t be able to earn your living. And it becomes very difficult. But  this is an artificial arrangement. This is not a natural arrangement. Some unfortunate  arrangements has been made in this world that has made life so complex. Actually to  survive, what do you need? All you need is food, water, air and to protect yourself you  need a house, to cover yourself you need clothes. These are the basic necessities of life.  But look at today’s world; what it has become. If you have just food and water, clothes  and shelter, that’s not enough. You have to have a colour TV, you have to have a  computer. You have to have a car. You have to have so many different useless things. In  order to have them you have to have money. And if you don’t have a skill, then you  won’t get a job. Because in today’s society you are made into a sudra through this  education system, unless you get a job you feel “Oh! What shall I do? I need a job”. If  you don’t get a job then your life is useless. But one can very easily go to the nature and cultivate. Prabhupada used to say that with  two acres of land and two cows, one can maintain a family. All you need is two acres of  land and two cows, and you can maintain your family. All that you need, your food etc.  you can get from the two acres of land. But in today’s world, no one will take that  proposal seriously. Their reaction is “Oh! Give me break! Two acres of land and two  cows! Where will I get the car? Where will I get the colour TV? And if I don’t, then my  life is meaningless”. All these education systems are absolutely meaningless. We don’t  need to learn all those things actually. When there was no computer, was there any need to learn how to run a computer? When there was no motor car, was there any need to  learn about a motor car? Did they live their lives in those days? But today they have  
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    made all kinds of educational arrangements. For everything there is an education.  Prabhupada was aghast when he heard that in Sweden, in schools, they give sex  education. Those days it was thirty years back, it was Sweden. Now all over the world it  is happening. Prabhupada’s reaction was, “What’s there to learn about sex life. Even a  dog knows.” So, human society has become so complex by some unnecessary  arrangements by some stupid fools. What is the motivation? The motivation is profit. They simply want to make money by  making fools of others. If you don’t learn this, your life is useless. What is the purpose? I  am going to enslave you; specialised slavery. The more we are actually getting into that  education system, the more we are becoming slaves of this demoniac culture. In this way  Kali is actually controlling everybody. These are all actually Kali’s arrangements to  control. Anyway, the bottom line is that learning things are good, provided you can use it  in Krishna’s service. Yesterday we were discussing that things have come and  Prabhupada used them. When Prabhupada went to America, first he was using a  typewriter to type. But then Prabhupada got a tape recorder and he started to use the tape  recorder to translate Bhagavad-gita. Then Prabhupada got a dictaphone. Then Prabhupada  got devotees to transcribe. Prabhupada used all these facilities in Krishna’s service. So  we do not say “No!”. In Krishna consciousness we don’t say “No” to anything excepting  those four things; no meat eating, no intoxication, no illicit sex and no gambling. Besides  that, “Yes, yes, yes!” For everything it’s Yes. Everything can be used in Krishna’s  service. You have a question Syamananda? Question: Guru Maharaj, you were saying that it is not enough just to receive vijnana, we  actually have to practice properly. So what does that actually mean in terms of the  preaching mission in being an ISKCON devotee. What does that mean to actually  practice properly in terms of ‘I am an ISKCON devotee, what is my responsibility’? Answer: Yes, practice is the application of the theoretical information. We understand  that we are spirit souls. Theoretically we understand. We understand that Krishna is God  and we understand that we have a relationship. But the practical application is to cultivate  that relationship. And there comes the sadhana bhakti, practicing of devotional service.  Yes, we have to practice. What Prabhupada instructed, now we have to apply, to put into  practice. Question: (Inaudible)…and preaching out to others? Answer: I see, preaching aspect. Yes, naturally. First we receive it and then we distribute  it; especially when we have a mission like spreading this movement all over the world.  When we have a responsibility to spread it all over the world, then everybody has to take  up that responsibility. Not just “I am practicing and that’s fine”. I say that is only fifty  percent. You are chanting sixteen rounds, following four regulative principles, practicing sadhana bhakti, rendering service; that is fifty percent. The other fifty percent is to go out  and make others chant Hare Krishna, following four regulative principles, render  devotional service. Question: How rare is it to get a human form? Why do we carry our karma from lifetime  to lifetime? Answer: How rare is it to get a human form? Extremely rare. You know how rare it is?  Even for a resident of heavenly planets, there is a description of it in Mahabharata. A  living entity goes to a heavenly planet due to his pious activities. When the pious  
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    activities are exhausted then he loses his right to remain in the heavenly planet and he  falls from the heavenly planet. When he is falling, below the heavenly planet there are the  rakshasas. The rakshasas catch him and eat him up. Due to that pain, he begins to shed  tears. His soul leaves the body through the tear drops. Those tear drops come down to the  earth with the rain drops. Then it enters into a plant. Then it enters into a grain. Then a  living entity eats that grain. Then the spirit soul goes into his semen. Then it enters into a  mother’s womb. There it develops a body, according to the mother. Now consider how  rare it is. It is not that every soul eaten by a man in the form of a grain, that enters into the  semen of that person will impregnate an ovum and get a body. And if one gets a body,  out of 8 400 000 species, the chances of getting the human form of life is only 400 000.  So see how rare it is. Therefore don’t squander this wonderful opportunity. Take full  advantage of this human form of life. It’s extremely rare. You may get a human form of  life. What’s the guarantee that you will come to Krishna consciousness. So we not only  got this human form of life, we got this opportunity to become Krishna conscious. It’s a  very, very rare opportunity. So we must take proper advantage of that. Question: You said that in Karma yoga one can act but at least offer the results to  Krishna if you want to enjoy but not suffer. Yet we see that the greater part of humanity  cannot even do that. Do they fall outside of this category? Answer: Yes. Most of the human society is out of that category. Karma yoga means  offering the results to Krishna. How many people accept Krishna? How many people  even accept God? And of those who accept God, out of that, how many of them accept  Him as a person? Of those who accept Him as a Person, how many of them accept Him  as Krishna; then to offer the results of your actions to Krishna; very rare. Question: How can we remain steady in Krishna consciousness without the mind being  distracted by so many things e.g. during chanting or even during daily life? Answer: Try to steady your mind. It will be difficult but keep on practising. That’s what  Krishna suggested. When Arjuna said that, “How shall I control the mind? It is very  difficult. It is more difficult to control the mind. It’s as difficult as controlling the wind”.  Then what was Krishna’s response to that? abhyasena tu kaunteya ,practice and vairagyena ca grhyate detachment If you remain attached to the different objects of the material senses then, yes, the mind  will remain unsteady. So recognise that in this material nature there is nothing to enjoy.  We have nothing to achieve in this material nature besides becoming Krishna conscious.  The only thing that matters in this world is our becoming Krishna conscious. So let’s try  to become Krishna conscious. Let’s take advantage of all these opportunities to become  Krishna conscious. Try to control the mind, try to control your actions. Sit down and try  to chant. When you cannot sit down at one place while chanting, what does it mean? It  means that your mind is unsteady. Because your mind is unsteady, you just want to go  here and there. If you want to go for a japa walk and chant; that is one thing. But please  take this into consideration, that here we are for these seven days to achieve something.  And we have designed this program in a certain way to achieve that. We have this one  hour. Probably from tomorrow we will be chanting for forty five minutes, not even one  hour. For these forty five minutes, make it a point to sit here and chant. The mind will  say, “Oh, let me go out”. The mind will say, “I have to make a phone call”. The mind will  
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    say so many things. But just control your mind say “Okay. For these forty five minutes,  just become steady”. And then you try to increase. The purpose of coming here to this  retreat is to achieve that actually; to steady our mind; to become steady in our devotional  service. I was actually considering the difference between a holiday or vacation and a retreat. Is  there a difference between a holiday, a vacation and a retreat? Now did you come for a  vacation or you came for a retreat? Please take this point seriously. You came for a  retreat. Retreat means retreat. You see when you are in the battlefield and you are losing  the battle, what does the general do? An expert general retreats. And he considers how to  plan his attack. So that’s what we are doing. We are retreating. We are withdrawing  ourselves from everything so, that life is left behind. For these few days, that life is left  behind. Now you are retreating. Now let us consider, how do we shape our spiritual life  for our own benefit. So this practice is going to be helpful. Yes, everybody actually  comes up with this question; how to steady my mind while chanting. Even Arjuna asked that question. Arjuna is asking that question, “Krishna, how shall I  control my mind? It is so unsteady.” Now consider Arjuna’s mind. Can you imagine how  steady Arjuna’s mind was? You know that story? You know the incident where  Dronacarya was giving a test to his students. He asked different students. He put a bird on  a thing and the point was to shoot the eye of the bird. And he asked everyone. Everyone  failed. “What are you seeing Yudhisthira?”. “I am seeing the bird, I am seeing the tree.”  I’m seeing, this I’m seeing that. “Forget it”. In this way Dronacarya asked everyone and  finally when he asked Arjuna, “Arjuna, what do you see?” Arjuna replied, “I see the  bird.” “What do you see?” “I see the bird’s head.” “What do you see?” “I see the bird’s  eye.” Dronacarya asked, “Don’t you see anything else?” Arjuna replied, “No.” Then  Dronacarya said, “Shoot.”Now consider what kind of mind Arjuna had to make it so steady. (laughter) How do you think Arjuna pierced the fish that was rotating? And where he had to shoot  that fish and make it drop, looking at a pool of water. How could he do that? Can you  imagine how steady, how focussed his mind was? And Arjuna is telling Krishna,  cancalam hi manah krsna. So then what to speak of us. (laughter) So let’s become  serious about these points. Don’t just ask the question. You know the answer. Now you  act accordingly. You know the answer. Now act accordingly. Since you have figured out  that your mind is unstable, now you know how to make it steady. Do it. But if you ask the  question and keep on doing your nonsense, there won’t be any benefit. Question: It is stated that if you take one step towards Krishna then He takes ten steps  towards you. So if out of many thousands, one may endeavour for perfection, does  Krishna from within as the Supersoul, help the devotee to fulfil his desire to perform  loving devotional service or does the devotee have to endeavour on his own completely? Answer: Very good question. The very simple answer to that is that yes, when you  surrender to Krishna, then Krishna takes care of you. Then you are not alone. Then  Krishna is helping you, because you took shelter of Krishna. When you surrender to  Krishna, what did you actually say “Krishna I am completely incapable, Krishna, I am  completely incompetent, I am completely useless, I do not know what to do. So You  please take care of me”. Krishna will say, “Okay fine. I will take care of you. But you surrender unto Me”. So you surrender and Krishna will take care. So it doesn’t matter.  Then this consideration of manusyanam saharesu doesn’t apply. If all the people surrender unto Krishna, Krishna will take care. And that is the good fortune that Srila  Prabhupada has created for us. Previously this point was as rare as that; manusyanam  saharesu. Out of thousands and thousands and thousands of people, one would become a  devotee of Krishna. But now, although it was so rare, Caitanya Mahaprabhu came and  gave it, “Okay. Become a devotee.”; direct opportunity. Then Prabhupada came and took  that mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and distributed it all over the world. Question: Hare Krishna Maharaj, you mentioned that one characteristic of the soul is that  it is not affected by material contamination? (HH Bhakti Caru Maharaj: Did I say that? I  don’t remember saying that. I don’t remember saying that the soul does not become  affected by material contamination). How is this strong defence mechanism broken, by  our behaviour and psychological vices like envy or jealously? Answer: Well, Krishna answered that point. He said, kama esa krodha esa rajo-guna-samudbhavahAll these entanglements in the material nature are simply due to lust and anger, which is  generated out of the influence of the mode of passion. And at the bottom of all that is our  false ego. So how to get rid of the false ego? The way to get rid of false ego is to  surrender to Krishna. Then the false ego will disappear. The false ego has been generated  due to aversion to Krishna. So you surrender to Krishna, the false ego will disappear. And  your real identity will become manifest. Question: When does actual devotional service begin? Do we have to be free from all  anarthas? Answer: Well, actual devotional service begins with shraddha. Adau shraddha. The  moment you accepted Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and identified  yourself as a servant, and you surrendered yourself unto Krishna, then your devotional  service began. Krishna is saying sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah So the beginning of devotional service is the surrender or saranagati. Just surrender to  Krishna. But in order to surrender you have to recognise Who is Krishna. Krishna is the  Supreme Personality of Godhead. With that understanding you surrender to Krishna.  That’s the beginning of devotional service. Anarthas may be there, but anarthas will  disappear gradually. When the cleansing process begins, all the dirt will become  cleansed. It’s not that first you have to clean the dirt and then you have to begin the  process. No. This process will purify you. Question: What if what I like to do, or enjoy doing, is not really within my nature? Is  liking something or enjoying an activity fully indicative of one’s nature? (HH Bhakti  Caru Maharaj: Well, I don’t understand that point.) What if what I like to do, or enjoy  doing, is not really within my nature? Answer: Rather it’s the other way around. What is actually inherent to your nature, that  is what you like to do. To say, what if I enjoy doing something that is not really within  my nature, then you won’t enjoy doing it. If you ask a tiger to eat grass, do you think he  will enjoy it? No, because the tiger’s nature is to eat meat. So when he gets meat, he  enjoys it. That’s his nature. Whereas a cow, when you give her grass, she enjoys it  
    
    http://www.bhakticharuswamilectures.co.in 
    
    because her nature is to eat grass. So whatever is your nature, that’s what you enjoy  doing; not something that is not in your nature that you enjoy doing. Question: Please share with us how to chant our rounds with feeling and longing? Thank  you.Answer: Very good question. Sometimes devotees ask, “How can I be attentive in my  chanting?” The first answer to that is, to try to hear when you are chanting; attentive  hearing. How do you receive sound? Do you receive sound through your tongue? Do you  receive sound through your eyes? How do you receive sound? Through hearing. So  receive the transcendental sound vibration and then remember Whose name you are  chanting. Who is He? He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So add some feeling to  your chanting. It’s out of love that you are chanting. You are trying to express your love.  Try to add that feeling to it. Question: When a person is about to leave his or her body, please explain what happens  to the Supersoul? Answer: The Supersoul is with the soul as a Witness. The soul is going to another body  and the Supersoul also goes. The Supersoul is with the soul. The soul goes with the subtle  body, and the Supersoul also goes with the individual. Question: I used to really have a hard time chanting but I saved the situation. I got up at  2am, chant my rounds, then do my other work which is secondary to the Lord. Maybe  other devotees can try this method. Answer: Okay. Good advice. How many of you are going to wake up at two o’ clock?  Okay. Whose point was that? That’s a good point. If not two o’ clock, then at least try to  get up early because the early hours are a very good time to chant. Thank you all very much. All glories to Srila Prabhupada! Gaura Premananda! Haribol.

    document.getElementById("main").innerHTML = `Chapter 1: Observing the Armies 

    Srimad Bhagavad Gita comprises the 25th to the 42nd chapters of the Bhishma Parva of the Mahabharata. Sage Vaisampayana narrated to Janamejaya the conversation between Dhrtarastra and Sanjaya about the battle of Kurukshetra. Due to the mercy of Vyasadeva, Sanjaya received divine vision and therefore although he was in Hastinapura, he could perceive the preparation of the battle in Kurukshetra and Krishna’s instructions to Arjuna and narrated that to Dhrtarastra. 
    
    The lamentation that developed due to the false identification with the material body has been described in this chapter. Conditioned soul identifies him with the material body. Then only the duties of the body, society, nation etc. appear to be the eternal religion of the soul, and becoming bewildered by Maya, the illusory energy of the Lord, one is overwhelmed by lamentation, illusion and fear. The consideration of duty or religion due to false identification of the body to be the self is mano dharma. 
    
    In this first chapter of Bhagavad Gita when Dhrtarastra asked Sanjaya about the battle of Kurukshetra, Sanjaya described how Duryodhana asked Dronacharya about the strength of his army. In order to increase Duryodhana’s enthusiasm, Bhishma blew his conch shell. On the other side, the Pandava army’s great enthusiasm also became obvious. Before the commence of the battle, in order to figure out whom he would have to fight with, Arjuna requested his charioteer Krishna to place his chariot between the two armies. At that time, seeing that his teacher, uncle, grandfather, father in law, son, grandson, brother in law and friends etc, his friends in relation to the body, Arjuna apparently became overwhelmed with lamentation and grief, and expressing his opinions on dharma and adharma, mentioned that due to the destruction of the dynasty, the eternal family tradition will be vanquished. When the religious principles become destroyed in this way, the family will become involved in irreligion. Gradually, due to the cessation of the performance of offering food and water to the ancestors, varnasrama dharma will be lost and the entire social structure will collapse. 
    
    Chapter 2: Sankhya Yoga 
    
    In this chapter known as Sankhya Yoga, Krishna instructed Arjuna about the symptoms of atma tattva (understanding of the self) and sthita prajna (person fixed in Krishna consciousness). He mentioned that to 
    
    become bewildered at the time of crisis is not befitting a person situated in Dharma, religion, and it is disgraceful and uncivilized. Therefore Arjuna should give up that mentality and must act like a member of the royal order. In response, Arjuna said that to win the kingdom by killing his teacher and relatives can never be appropriate. Krishna replied that a wise man, who is free from the bodily concept of life and is not bewildered by false ego, never laments for anyone because the gross body made of the 5 material elements and the subtle body made of mind, intelligence and false ego are subject to creation and destruction, whereas the soul is eternal. Just as one puts on a new dress giving up the old ones, similarly a conditioned soul transmigrates from one body to another. The material body made of five material elements is temporary and can be killed; however, the proprietor of the body, the soul, is eternal, imperishable and most difficult to understand. Unconditional devotional service to the lotus feet of the Lord is the dharma of the spirit soul. 
    
    There is no loss or diminution in the devotional service of the Lord. When one performs pure devotional service, even to a small extent, he becomes free from the great fear of material existence. The vyavasayatmika buddhi – the understanding that “If I serve Krishna I will achieve the ultimate auspiciousness” should be the sole objective of a person desirous of the ultimate goal of life. Those who are foolish become attracted to the flowery words of the Vedas and giving up devotional service, accept different paths that are inferior to the devotional service of the Lord. 
    
    The karma kanda section of the Vedas deals with the three modes of material nature (goodness, passion and ignorance). The duty of a real intelligent person is to reject that and accept pure devotional service. All the results and benefits that have been described in the Vedas are there in devotional service. Those who are fruitive, those who want to enjoy the results of their actions, are indeed miserly. 
    
    When Arjuna asked about the symptoms of a self-realized soul, Krishna informed – A self-realized soul, sthita-prajna, does not have any other desire besides serving Krishna. 
    
    He is equipoised. The duality of this material nature, like auspicious and inauspicious, pleasure and pain, heat and cold etc. do not affect him. He is averse to material activities and attached to the blissful involvement of Krishna bhakti.  He is situated on the perfect spiritual path. 
    
    A conditioned soul becomes attached to the objects of sense gratification. Due to his attachment, he develops lust, from lust anger, due to anger he becomes bewildered about what to do and what not to do, and as a result of that he forgets the instructions of the scriptures and spiritual master and as a result of that his intelligence is destroyed and he achieves a state that is almost like a dead man. 
    
    One whose intelligence is completely withdrawn from sense enjoyment is situated in real knowledge. 
    
    To a conditioned soul, self discipline is like night, but a sense controlled person is awake in that. Conditioned souls are awake in sense gratification whereas to a self-realized soul that is like night. 
    
    One who has become free from all desire and has become totally detached, free from false ego and all feeling of proprietorship achieves peace. Such a person never becomes bewildered. What to speak of prolonged situation of Brahma sthiti, if one achieves that state even at the time of death, he achieves liberation. The second chapter is known as Gita-sutra because in this chapter karma and jnana have been described very clearly. However, devotional service, bhakti, has not been described so clearly. Actually the dharma of the soul is the eternal constitutional dharma of the jiva, whereas the dharma of the body is temporary and conditional. 
    
    Chapter 3: Karma Yoga 
    
    In this chapter selfless action, niskama karma, and its goal, knowledge, jnana, have been described. In the previous chapter, after hearing about the superiority of vyavasayatmika buddhi, Arjuna asked in this chapter, “Krishna, why are you then provoking me into action?” 
    
    In reply Krishna told that according to pure heart and impure heart there are two types of dedication in the practice of devotional service. The pure hearted ones become attached to sankhya, jnana yoga, and the ones with impure heart, offering the results of their actions to the Lord through niskama karma yoga, become elevated to the platform of jnana and become free from the bondage of matter due to the mercy of bhakti. 
    
    Unless one acts according to the instructions of the scriptures, one cannot achieve knowledge that is manifest in the form of inaction. One cannot stay without action even for a moment. Conditioned souls are compelled to act due to the influence of the three modes of material nature. Those who externally control the working senses but internally meditate on the objects of the senses are pretenders. Those who are not qualified to renounce their actions, for them it is better to be engaged in action. However, if the activities are not for the pleasure of Vishnu, then those actions become the cause of bondage. Therefore one must act only for the sake of serving Vishnu without being attached to the results. Those who are unable to become detached, they should act with attachment but offer the results of their actions to the Lord. When one offers foodstuffs to the demigods through the panca-maha-yajnas and accepts the remnants of the yajna, one becomes free from sinful reactions. If foodstuffs are not offered to the demigods then that becomes stealing. Those who are engaged in action but do not perform sacrifice become servants of their senses and uselessly waste their human form of life. Exalted personalities like Janaka who were perfectly situated on the platform of knowledge, jnana, achieved perfection through karma. 
    
    Common people generally follow the great personalities. Therefore Krishna instructed Arjuna that he should act without desiring for the results of his action for the sake of teaching the general population. He instructed Arjuna not to bewilder the fruitive workers. On the other hand he should teach them how to become engaged in the service of Vishnu through all their actions. 
    
    All actions are performed by the influence of the modes of material nature, however, being bewildered by false ego people consider themselves to be the doers. A person situated in perfect knowledge never considers himself to be as such. 
    
    “O Arjuna, give up all your actions to Me, remembering that I am your Supersoul and you are doing everything under My direction. In this way, becoming free from desire, attachment and lamentation fight. 
    
    “Those who always follow My instructions with faith and devoid of envy, become free from the bondage of karma. Those foolish individuals, who, due to envy do not follow My instructions, are ruined in their endeavour for perfection.” It is better to discharge one’s prescribed duty faultily than another’s duty perfectly. Destruction in course of performing one’s duty is better than engaging in another’s duty, for to follow another’s path is dangerous. 
    
    Hearing these instructions of Krishna, Arjuna again asked, “O Krishna, why does one become compelled in sinful actions even unwillingly as if engaged by force?” Krishna replied, “Lust and anger, which are born of the material mode of passion, engage one in sinful activities. On the path of liberation lust and anger are two extremely dangerous enemies. A living entity’s pure consciousness is covered by this lust and anger. In the conditioned state the living entity mistakes his senses, mind and intelligence to be him. Senses are superior to inert matter, mind is superior to the senses, intelligence is superior to mind and the one who is superior even to intelligence is the spirit soul. 
    
    “Arjuna, steadying your mind with deliberate spiritual intelligence (Krishna consciousness) conquers this formidable enemy known as lust.” The points to note in this chapter are, giving up renunciation of action that is devoid of Krishna consciousness; one should become engaged in devotional service to Krishna. Then only one will be able to become free from the dangerous bondage of karma. Lust and anger are the root cause of all sufferings. Devotional service destroys that. 
    
    Chapter 4: Jnana Yoga. 
    
    Krishna instructed Jnana Yoga or transcendental knowledge to the Sun god Vivasvan. Vivasvan gave it to Manu, who in turn gave it to Ikshvaku. In this way through a disciplic succession the saintly kings receive 
    
    transcendental knowledge by the performance of niskama karma yoga. Since that science got lost in course of time, Krishna revealed jnana yoga to Arjuna. Whenever there is a decline in religious principles and a predominant rise of irreligion, the Lord appears and establishes the principles of religion by delivering the pious and annihilating the miscreants. Taking shelter of His internal potency, He manifests His original transcendental form. His appearance and all other activities are transcendental. One who knows that fact becomes free from the cycle of birth and death by becoming aware of his relationship with Him and becoming engaged in His loving devotional service. 
    
    In order to get a quick result, the fruitive workers worship the demigods. The four divisions of human society have been created according to the three modes of material nature and the work associated with them. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the creator of this system and yet His is a non-doer. 
    
    Lusty living entities, misusing their independence, become subjected to the results of their actions produced by the three modes of material nature. Those who perform actions without any desire for enjoying their fruits, burn the results of their actions with the fire of knowledge. Those who perform their actions only for the sake of maintaining their bodies in order to render devotional service to the Lord become free from the reactions of both sinful and pious actions. When the five limbs of yajna, offering, ingredients, fire, performer and result become Krishna conscious, then only the yajna becomes successful. Such a performer of yajna is a real yogi. The self realized spiritual master imparts the transcendental knowledge to a disciple who approaches him with respect, inquires from him submissively and renders service unto him. 
    
    With the fire of transcendental knowledge, karma is burnt. Those who have faith in the words of the spiritual master, who are eager to serve the Lord and who have subdued the senses are eligible to receive transcendental knowledge. Those who are doubtful and have no faith in the revealed scriptures fall down. For such a doubting soul, there is no happiness either in this world or in the next. Therefore the duty of a submissive disciple is to cut this doubt with the weapon of transcendental knowledge and become engaged in the loving devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 
    
    Chapter 5: Karma Yoga: Action in Krishna consciousness. 
    
    In this chapter Krishna dispelled the doubts of Arjuna about renunciation of action and yoga of devotional service, and instructed him that real renunciation is to give up attachments to fruitive actions. After attaining this state of renunciation, when one becomes engaged in activities that are meant to please Vishnu, one realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead and achieves transcendental peace. Arjuna asked, “Between renunciation of action and engagement in devotional service, which one is better?” Krishna replied that unconditional devotional service is better than renunciation of action. Real renunciation is not just cessation of action, but rejection of the attachment to the results of action. True sannyasa is to become detached from both attachment and aversion. 
    
    Sankhya yoga and karma yoga are not different. A wise man situated in yoga performs his actions without attachment. On the other hand, a fruitive worker, karmi, is bound by the attachment of the fruits of his action. When a living entity becomes covered by avidya, ignorance, he considers himself to be the doer. 
    
    Those who are fixed in the Supreme attain liberation. Those who have equal vision are truly learned. Those with fixed intelligence never become perturbed by fame or infamy – they are situated in transcendence. As long as they are in their material bodies, those who tolerate the urges of desire and anger through devotional service, are truly happy in this world. One whose happiness is within, who is active in his spiritual situation and rejoices within, and whose aim is inward is a true yogi, and attains the Supreme (Brahma nirvana). A karma yogi knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate beneficiary of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods, and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attains transcendental peace. 
    
    Chapter 6: Dhyana Yoga 
    
    Without meditating upon the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead, just by renunciation of action, one cannot attain liberation. One who renounces desire for sense gratification is a yogi. However, one who renders devotional service to the Lord with great faith is the best among all yogis. 
    
    One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and works as if he is obligated, is in the renounced order of life (sannyasa) and is a yogi. Sannyasa and yoga have the same meaning. For a neophyte devotee, karma is the means and for an advanced devotee, cessation of all material actions is the means. One who is elevated in yoga neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities. For a conditioned soul, mind can either be his friend or his enemy. For one who has conquered his mind, the mind is the best friend; however, for one who has failed to do that, his mind will remain his greatest enemy. One who has conquered the mind has already reached the supersoul, i.e. he has attained the stage of Samadhi. 
    
    The purpose of yoga is to focus the mind at the lotus feet of Krishna. One who is regulated in his habits of eating, sleeping, recreation and work, is qualified to practice yoga. The mind of a yogi is unwavering.  The perfection of yoga, the fruits of yoga practice, can be achieved by perseverance and tolerance. When mind becomes completely controlled through dhyana, dharana and samadhi, one can realize the self. The true yogi sees the supersoul in all living beings and every living being in the supersoul. 
    
    When Arjuna asked how the extremely restless mind can be controlled, Krishna replied that only through practice of detachment and experience of spiritual bliss can the mind be controlled. A transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities will never be overcome by evil. The unsuccessful yogi, after many many years of enjoyment in the higher planets, takes birth in a family of righteous people or into a family of rich aristocracy. Or he takes birth in a family of yogis, who are great in wisdom, and again revives the divine consciousness from his previous life and automatically becomes attracted to the yogic principles. Such an inquisitive transcendentalist, striving for yoga, stands always above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures. A yogi, after many many births of practice, being washed of all contamination, ultimately attains the supreme goal. 
    
    A yogi is greater than the ascetic, empiricist and fruitive worker. And of all yogis, one who always worships Sri Krishna in transcendental loving service with great faith is the highest of all because he is most intimately connected to Krishna.

    PURPORT
    When an embodied living entity is hurt by fatal weapons, it is to be known that the living entity within the body is not killed. The spirit soul is so small that it is impossible to kill him by any material weapon, as will be evident from subsequent verses. Nor is the living entity killable, because of his spiritual constitution. What is killed, or is supposed to be killed, is the body only. This, however, does not at all encourage killing of the body. The Vedic injunction is ma himsyat sarva bhutani: never commit violence to anyone. Nor does understanding that the living entity is not killed encourage animal slaughter. Killing the body of anyone without authority is abominable and is punishable by the law of the state as well as by the law of the Lord. Arjuna, however, is being engaged in killing for the principle of religion, and not whimsically.
    [End of Purport]
    ya enam vetti hantaram
    yas cainam manyate hatam
    ubhau tau na vijanito
    nayam hanti na hanyate
    So, Arjuna at the battlefield of Kurukshetra refused to fight the battle. Just when the battle was about to begin both the armies were facing each other in the holy land of Kurukshetra. The conchshell was already blown. That means the war has already begun. And at that point Arjuna seeing that in the enemy line his intimate relatives and friends are standing as his enemies, he became so overwhelmed with compassion and emotion that he told Krishna that he couldn’t fight the battle.
    
    He saw his grandfather, Bhishma. He saw his guru, Dronacarya. He saw his friends, and uncles and cousins standing in the enemy line like Duryodhana, Ashvatthama, Kripacarya, Shalva. They were all very, very closely related to each other. Arjuna was practically brought up at the lap of Bhishma and now he is standing against him. And this battle was so terrible and the battle was so fierce that it was a matter of either kill or getting killed. A warrior never thinks that he is going to get killed. He thinks that he is going to kill everybody. So Arjuna’s mood at that time and Arjuna’s feeling at that time was, that how could I possibly release arrows to kill these individuals who are so close to me.
    
    katham bhishmam aham sankhye
    dronam ca madhusudana
    ishubhih pratiyotsyami
    pujarhav ari-sudana
    [Bg. 2.4]
    Katham, how can I in this [unclear], in this war, ishubhih pratiyotsyami, release my arrows to Bhishma, dronam ca madhusudana, and Drona as well. Because they are pujarhav, they are my worshipable spiritual gurus, spiritual master and grandfather. Pujarhav ari-sudana, they are my worshipable lords and relatives.
    
    In this way Arjuna was giving many reasons and arguments why to fight this battle was not possible for him. But at the end Arjuna actually submitted to Krishna. He told Him that, “I don’t know what I should do. I am accepting You as my spiritual master. So You please tell me what I should do. Please guide me.” At that point Krishna started to advise Arjuna.
    
    Prabhupada mentioned that Krishna did not say anything to Arjuna until Arjuna accepted Him as guru and submitted himself to Him. And when he did that then Krishna started to tell him. And what was the first thing that Krishna told him? Krishna told him that, “Look, you are lamenting over things that one should not lament about. Asocayan anvasocas tvam [Bg. 2.11] Yes, prajna-vadams va bhasase, you are speaking like prajna-vadams, speaking like a pandita, speaking like a wise man. You are speaking like a wise man but actually you don’t have any knowledge. You are lamenting over something that one shouldn’t lament about. And gatasun agatasums ca nanusocanti panditah. One who is really situated in knowledge doesn’t lament about something that is transient and perishable. And then Krishna started to explain to Arjuna the science of Bhagavad Gita.
    
    From verse…in this chapter, second chapter actually, Krishna started to advise Arjuna. Verse twelve onwards and today we are discussing about the nineteenth verse. In previous seven verses Krishna gave enough information to Arjuna about the permanent nature of the soul and the transient, perishable nature of the body. So in this way Krishna is actually explaining to Arjuna the difference between matter and spirit. We are in a world of matter, material world. This is the world of matter and by nature matter is inert, dead matter. Matter is dead. Matter is inert. Matter is unconscious. Matter is devoid of life. But in this world of dead matter you see some living things. Why and how? That is what Krishna actually established. Like, the body is made of matter but it is due to the presence of the soul that the body made of dead matter is alive. This is the first thing that Bhagavad Gita is establishing or this science is establishing: to understand the difference between matter and spirit. This seat where I am sitting, asana, is inert matter. This table is inert. This microphone is inert. The wall is inert. But we all are living. What causes us to be alive? To understand that, we can consider that when someone dies, although his body maybe lying there, but we say, “He is gone.” He is gone. Although his lying there we say, “He is gone.” So who is that ‘he’? Whose departure from the body made the body become dead? To begin with it is a dead body. A body made of dead matter is a dead body but it is due to the presence of the soul that the body is alive, meaning the body becomes conscious. It is a very simple common sense matter but we fail to recognize this point until we come across scriptures like Bhagavad Gita and teachers like Srila Prabhupada.
    Many of us, especially those of you who are coming from India and you few who are from the West also must have read Bhagavad Gita before. I read about seven different Bhagavad Gitas before coming across Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita As It Is. I used to carry a Bhagavad Gita with me and I used to read from Bhagavad Gita, take note from Bhagavad Gita and I used to think I am understanding so much from Bhagavad Gita. But when I came across Srila Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita I realized that I didn’t understand anything of Bhagavad Gita.
    
    In this respect I recall one incidence. One of Prabhupada’s first disciples was Brahmananda prabhu. Those days Prabhupada used to live at the back of twenty sixth Second Avenue in a small apartment. And in the front there was the ‘Matchless Gifts’. There Prabhupada used to give discourses on the Bhagavad Gita in the evening. So one day Brahmananda prabhu, who was a teacher, school teacher, was passing by and he saw this. And he got to know the Swami is here, he is giving these courses on Bhagavad Gita in the evening. So he wanted to meet the Swami, Srila Prabhupada. And he went to Srila Prabhupada. He had an appointment. Prabhupada was ready to see him. So when he went to Srila Prabhupada he tried to impress Srila Prabhupada by saying that he also read Bhagavad Gita and he had a Bhagavad Gita with him also. So Prabhupada was naturally impressed, but Prabhupada told him, “Okay, just open any page of the Bhagavad Gita”, that he was carrying. So he opened that page, just opened one page like that and Prabhupada said, “Read.” So he read and Prabhupada said, “Close the book.” He closed the book. Prabhupada said, “Tell me what you understood.” And Brahmananda realized that he didn’t understand anything! [laughter] And then Prabhupada explained that to understand Bhagavad Gita you need a bona fide teacher, a qualified teacher. A bona fide spiritual master. And that kind of bona fide spiritual masters are rare in this world, who really understand Bhagavad Gita. Srila Prabhupada is one such rare spiritual master and Srila Prabhupada came and he presented Bhagavad Gita As It Is. Why Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita is entitled as ‘Bhagavad Gita As It Is’? How many of you know? How many of you want to know? Okay! [Laughs] If you add ‘It Is’, Prabhupada explains ‘As It Is’ meaning the way Krishna gave it and the way Arjuna understood it. That is what makes Bhagavad Gita ‘As It Is’: the way Krishna spoke and the way Arjuna understood it.
    
    There are many Bhagavad Gitas. I remember in 1976 actually we took a survey. I was new in the movement. Tukarama prabhu while introducing me told I joined in 1976 and we were making a survey of Bhagavad Gita and we found that there were more than 250 translations of Bhagavad Gita. And we also noted that all those 250 Bhagavad Gitas put together did not make a single devotee of Krishna, whereas Srila Prabhupada’s one Bhagavad Gita As It Is was making thousands of devotees, now maybe hundreds of thousands of devotees all over the world. Not only hundreds of thousands, more than that, millions of devotees all over the world. That is the potency of Srila Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita. Most of the Bhagavad Gitas what they did was they took the words of Krishna but they gave their interpretation. Not the way Arjuna understood, they accepted the way Krishna spoke, but they did not accept the way Arjuna understood it. They did their speculation. Oh, Krishna is this, Krishna is that. Bhagavad Gita means this and so on and so forth. But Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita is the authentic Bhagavad Gita, the bona fide Bhagavad Gita because it is presenting Arjuna’s understanding of this wisdom that is spoken by Krishna. Bhagavad Gita was given to Arjuna, it was for him to understand and act accordingly. And we in order to derive the specific benefit out of the Bhagavad Gita we have to follow that course, the way Arjuna understood.
    
    In Bhagavad Gita Mahatmya, in the glorification of Bhagavad Gita, describing the essence of Bhagavad Gita, it has been mentioned “sarvopanishado gavo”, all the Upanishads have been compared to a cow. Dogdha gopalanandana, and who gave the cow? Upanishad is a cow and the milker of that cow is Gopala Krishna, Krishna. And this cow gives the milk for the sake of the calf, Arjuna. Arjuna is the calf of this cow. And those who are really intelligent, those who are seriously concerned about their spiritual welfare they drink this milk of Bhagavad Gita. They drink this nectar of Bhagavad Gita.
    
    sarvopanishado gavo dogdha gopalanandana
    parthovatsa sudhirbhoktha dugdham gitamrtam mahat
    
    This dugdham Gita, Gita is a milk which is like amrtam. What is the characteristic of nectar? What is the specific quality of nectar? The Sanskrit word for nectar is ‘amrta’. Amrta means negation of death. Negation of death, meaning immortality. You read Bhagavad Gita you become immortal. You’ll achieve immortality. That is the real purpose of Bhagavad Gita. How? As you are reading now, Krishna is pointing out that the body is perishable. Body dies but the soul is immortal.
    The next verse you will see that point very clearly: na jayate mriyate va kadacin [Bg 2.20]. This spirit soul is never born nor will it ever die. Na jayate means it is never born. Mriyate va kadacin, nor will it ever die. Ajo nityah sasvato ‘yam purano na hanyate na hanyamane sarire. Even if the body is slain, even if the body is killed the soul cannot be killed. Soul may leave the body. In a certain condition when the body is severed by some weapon or body is burned by fire then the soul may leave the body and when the soul leaves the body, body dies but the soul never dies. And what is our real identity? Our actual identity is the body or the soul? [audience: soul] Very good! How many of you think that you are a spirit soul? Thank you. And the soul is immortal. How many of you accept that the soul is immortal? Thank you! So you are a spirit soul and the soul is immortal. Therefore you are…? [audience: immortal] So you reached your immortality? [audience: yes!] Right from the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita you reached immortality! [laughter] Dughdam gitamrtam mahat, this great, nectarian milk of the Bhagavad Gita gives us immortality. Drink it and become immortal. But how do you drink this nectar? Some things you drink with your mouth and some things else you drink with your ears. You drink this nectar of Bhagavad Gita through your ears and you will achieve immortality.
    So in the second chapter that is what Krishna is doing, at the beginning of the second chapter. Krishna is reminding Arjuna and through Arjuna Krishna is actually reminding us. This is an important point to also consider through this analogy of the milk of the cow. Although the cow gives milk for the sake of the calf but the calf doesn’t drink all the milk. Those who have any experience with cows you know that if the calf drinks all the milk of the cow or if the calf drinks too much of the milk the calf becomes sick. So that means it’s nature’s arrangement that cow’s milk is meant for human beings. Cow gives the milk, of course the calf is the impetus for the milk of the cow, but it is meant for the human beings to drink.
    So similarly, Krishna gave Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna that the actual purpose of Bhagavad Gita is for human beings to drink it. Sudhi, sudhi. Wich people, with individuals drink this milk. Sudhi. Dhi means intelligence. And su means very advanced, very developed. Also it means very beautiful. So whose intelligence is advanced, whose intelligence is active and whose intelligence is beautiful, Bhagavad Gita is meant for them. It is meant for those individuals.
    It needs a certain degree of intelligence to actually understand and appreciate Bhagavad Gita, and when you begin to appreciate Bhagavad Gita we see what an inconceivable wealth of wisdom this Bhagavad Gita contains. Everything is there in Bhagavad Gita. At the beginning of Bhagavad Gita we are getting the understanding of the soul and our identities being spiritual. Before coming across Bhagavad Gita or before coming across Srila Prabhupada’s teachings how many of you considered that you are a spirit soul? Okay. And what was your understanding of spirit soul? Think about it very deeply. Did you really have a clear understanding of spirit soul? Before coming across Prabhupada’s Bhagavad Gita or Prabhupada’s teachings there was no clear understanding of who the soul is. Actually, I mean, I don’t know in America but I came across a very well educated, well set person from the European background, Christian background. He is the grandfather of one of our devotees and I was having a discussion with him. He was a High Court judge and I had a difficult time to make him understand that animals have souls. His belief was that animals don’t have souls and here he is a High Court judge. It took me about twenty minutes to make him understand what actually the soul is. So main thing is that he didn’t have any understanding about what the soul is, therefore, he just went along with the Christian concept: only human beings have souls, animals don’t have souls.
    So the reality is that wherever there is life, wherever there is consciousness, we have to conclude that there is a soul. Trees and plants, are they conscious? [Audience: yes] Therefore, they are living. Therefore, there is a spirit soul. The trees are borne and the trees will die at some point just as human beings. Animals are conscious. You beat an animal it will cry. You attack an animal and it will defend itself. So this is how we can see that wherever there is consciousness we have to conclude that there is a spirit soul. Now the nature of the spirit soul…Yes, we may have accepted the existence of the spirit soul and the identity of the spirit soul, or the identity being spiritual, but there is no clear understanding of what a spirit soul is. Now let’s get a better understanding of the spirit soul. The spirit soul is what makes this body alive.
    Spirit soul is the source of consciousness. It is due to the presence of spirit soul that the body is alive. The body goes through so many wonderful changes the body performs so many wonderful activities. Like every single organ of this body is such a complex mechanism… like the kidney, a simple organ of this body. What does it do? It is filtering the blood. The blood in the course of circulation is becoming impure, contaminated and the kidney is purifying that. When it goes bad, then we have to go for dialysis and a huge complex machine but in the body it is naturally there without even us knowing about it. So this is the result of the presence of the soul. The soul is in the body and so many wonderful organs are functioning .The kidney, the liver, the lungs, the heart and on top of that the blood circulation, the respiratory system, nervous system, and the brain, like… simply due to the presence of the soul and that is our real identity. We are spirit soul. That is what we understand when we study the scriptures like Bhagavad Gita. Bhagavad Gita gives us a very basic understanding. First consideration is difference between the matter and spirit, the body and soul, and we begin to recognize that our actual identity is spiritual and that is immortal. The soul is immortal – we change the body. The departure of the soul from one body is called death and the acceptance of a new body by the soul is called birth. Birth is soul’s acceptance of a new body and death is the soul’s departure from the old body. And the period between, as long as the soul is in the body we call it life.
    Jai Sri Sri Pancatattava Ki Jai;
    Sri Krsna Caitanya Prabhu Nityananda Sri Advaita Gadhara Srivasadi Gaura Bhakta Vrinda
    So that is what so wonderfully has been explained. And then it goes to understanding Krishna. We understand the soul, we being spiritual, our identity being spiritual, we being spirit soul. And then we get to understand the difference between us and the supreme soul – Krishna. That also Krishna has done very wonderfully in the 4th chapter. In the second chapter Krishna has established the identity of spiritual entity called the Spirit soul. In the 3rd chapter Krishna gives the knowledge of Karma yoga – how to function. This arrangement from the time of creation has been designed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and there are different arrangements. There are demigods, there are living entities and the demigods are here to supply the needs of the human beings and the human beings in return are supposed to react towards the demigods in certain ways like paying them tax in the form of sacrifices and so forth and then in the beginning of 4th chapter Krishna told Arjuna that I gave this knowledge first to Vivashvan – the Sun God
    imam vivasvate yogam proktavn aham avyayam, vivasvan manave praha then Sun God Vivasvan gave it to his son Manu manur iksvakave ‘bravit…then Manu gave it to his son Ikvasku. evam parampara-praptam imam rajarsayo viduh…in this way through a chain of disciplic succession of saintly kings, this knowledge was flowing, but in course of time it has become lost. sa kaleneha mahata yogo nastah parantapa. Then he says, sa evayam maya te ‘dya yogah proktah puratanah…now that whole yoga that I have spoken long time ago, I will give it to you, to re-establish this wisdom. Then Arjuna had a natural question because we have to understand the relationship between Arjuna and Krishna is that of cousins. Arjuna’s mother was Krishna’a aunt and Krishna’s father was Arjuna’s uncle. They were brother and sister. Vasudev and Kunti were brother and sister. So that way they were relatives – cousins. And they were of the same age. Therefore they had a very intimate relationship. So Arjuna naturally asked him, look Krishna you are born just the other day aparam? bhavato janma param janma param janma vivasvatah?…Vivasvan was born so long ago param? janma vivasvatah? katham etad vijnayam tvam dau proktavan iti. How can we understand you spoke this wisdom to Vivasvan because Vivasvan was born so many millions of years ago and you were born just the other day. How can I understand that you have spoken? Then Krishna told him bah?ni me vyat?t?ni janm?ni tava c?rjuna t?ny aham? veda sarv?n?i na tvam? vettha parantapa. Many many times both you and I have taken birth. But about those births, you do not remember anything whereas I remember everything. t?ny aham? veda sarv?n?i. Sarvani means all – about all those births, all those activities, of every single moment I remember everything and then Krishna says that actually I am unborn, I don’t need to take birth but still I take birth, not take birth, I appear by the arrangement of my internal potency – yoga maya. ajo ‘pi sann avyayam bhatanam isvaro ‘pi san prakritim svam adhisthaya sambhavamy atma-mayaya…atma mayayaya, my internal potency, sambhavani, not borne, sambhavami manifest by, and why Krishna comes that He explains – when there is a decline of religious principles and increase of irreligiosity, to establish the principle of dharma, principle of religion He comes. So in this way Krishna establishes the difference between us and Him. We should not think that Krishna is one of us, No, Krishna is the origin of all of us, Krishna is the source of all of us. So in this way in Upanishads example is given just like the sun and innumerable rays are coming out of the sun. Now each ray of the sun qualitatively is one with the sun but quantitatively they are different. It is a tiny little ray whereas the sun is an inconceivable source of all the rays. We are tiny, we are minute but Krishna is absolute. Krishna is the absolute. But qualitatively we are same. Krishna is sachidananda, Krishna is spiritual, we are spiritual. Krishna is sac-cid-ananda. Krishna is eternal, full of knowledge, full of bliss. We are also eternal, full of bliss. But those qualities, the spiritual qualities of Krishna will be there in us only when we are connected with Him. When we become submissive to Krishna we become endowed with those qualities. But when we become separated from Krishna we lose those qualities. An example has been given. Like, a spark is also fire. A spark is fire, isn’t it? But the spark is a tiny part, a tiny speck of fire. When the spark comes out of the fire then what happens? Yeah, it loses its fiery qualities. It’s extinguished and it falls on a heap of ash just next to the fire. And it becomes ash, losing its fiery qualities. Our condition is somewhat like that. We are spiritual but being separated from Krishna we lost our spiritual qualities and falling into matter we are now identifying ourselves with matter. We are thinking we are this body. The speck of fire that was a spark now it became ash, but it has the ability to be ignited. But for that it has to go back to the fire. Similarly when we reestablish our relationship with Krishna we resume our spiritual qualities. And Krishna consciousness means to establish our relationship with Krishna again. Now we are identifying ourselves with matter and as a result of that we are thinking we are the body and we are functioning according to the moves of the body, according the demands of the body and according to the cravings of the body. But when we reestablish our relationship with Krishna then we will regain our spiritual qualities again. Just as you take the speck of inflammable particle that used to be a spark at one time back to fire, what happens? Immediately it becomes fire. So that is what Krishna consciousness is.
    
    And how to reestablish our lost relationship with Krishna? By developing our loving relationship with Him. Love is the criteria. Love is the force. Love is the factor that unites us with Krishna and that love is called bhakti or devotional service. Devotional service, love, real love is expressed through service, through action. So if we love Krishna we have to express that love, because we are active elements. We all are active individuals. We have to act. So when we act in order to express our love for Krishna then we become reconnected, reunited with Him. So that is the simple teaching of Bhagavad Gita and all the Vedic scriptures.
    Thank you all very much! Hare Krishna! [applause]
    Thank you. Does anybody have any question or comment? Yes?
    
    Question: Maharaja, can you please explain the difference between Yoga maya, Atma maya and Daivi maya?
    BCS: Yes, actually Daivi maya,Yoga Maya and Atma maya is the same. Maya means energy of the Lord. And there are two types of energies in that respect: external energy which is called Maha maya and internal energy of the Lord which is called Yoga maya or Atma maya or Daivi maya. Daivi hy esa guna-mayi [Bg 7.14]. So here it is Daivi because although indicating Maha maya but it is implying that this maya is Mine, therefore it is Daivi maya. Daivi means divine. But maya actually is a potency of the Lord it also means the illusory effect of the Lord’s energy. In both the natures, in material and spiritual, the Lord’s energy is bewildering us. Like, in the material nature it is bewildering us and taking us away from Krishna, and imprisoning us into the material nature. Whereas in the spiritual nature Yoga maya is engaging us in Krishna’s service making the arrangements. That’s also a kind of illusion. Especially Yoga maya is in Vrindavana. In Vrindavana Yoga maya causes the living entities or devotees or residents of Vrindavana to forget that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But here also we can consider that this maya is of two types. Maya means illusion. Illusion means not to recognize an object as it is. That’s what illusion is. So in the material nature our illusion or forgetfulness is due to our ignorance. But in the spiritual nature the forgetfulness of Krishna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Yogamaya’s arrangement, or the effect of Yogamaya which is due to love. Forgetfulness due to love. One is, sometimes we forget due to our ignorance and sometimes we forget due to love. For example, the son became the state president. It’s not that the mother doesn’t know that her son is the state president but because of her love for him she doesn’t care that he is the state president. It is not important that he is the state president. If he comes home late she chastises him, “What were you doing so late?!” So this is the forgetfulness due to love.
    There were some questions? Yes?
    
    Question: You were explaining that this is Bhagavad Gita As It Is, or this way Krishna spoke the subject, right? And Vyasadeva is the one who compiled it [unclear]. So what Krishna said and what Arjuna understood did Vyasadeva explain that?
    BCS: Very good. You see, what Vyasadeva did, he just…these personalities like Vyasadeva they have an inconceivable memory. Like, you can consider a tape recorder. Their memory is like a first class tape recorder. Everything is recorded here. And they could repeat it anytime. So, after Krishna’s pastimes Vyasadeva got Ganesha to write. So Vyasadeva was just narrating what was happening and he wrote. Vyasadeva didn’t give any commentary, but the understanding comes from a qualified teacher. Vyasadeva wrote the book who is like a publisher. He printed the book and marketed the book. But you, just by buying the book from a bookshop cannot master the subject. So what’s your profession? [Audience member: engineer] You are an engineer. To become an engineer what you have to do? You go to an engineering college, you have to study the books according to the syllabus and then under the guidance of a qualified teacher. So it is a qualified teacher who simplifies the knowledge from the book. So that is the business of a teacher. So here, Prabhupada, as a perfect teacher he explained the actual meaning of Bhagavad Gita the way Krishna spoke and the way Arjuna understood. I will tell you one thing. As I was telling about reading Bhagavad Gita, I was reading Bhagavad Gita and actually one inconceivable (?) thing I would kind of feel at that time, when I was reading second chapter I thought second chapter is THE Bhagavad Gita. Then I went to the first chapter I said, “Well, this is IT!
    
    Here is Prabhupada as a perfect teacher, he is explaining the actual meaning of Bhagavad Gita the way Krsna spoke and the way Arjuna understood. That’s way you will see, like why I will tell you one thing… as I was telling you about reading Bhagavad Gita. I was reading Bhagavad Gita and actually one confusing thing that I used to kind of feel at one time. When I as reading 2nd chapter, I felt 2nd chapter is the Bhagavad Gita then I went to the 3rd chapter, I felt this is it and then when I went to the 4th chapter I felt this is it.
    
    But Srila Prabhupada when he gave Bhagavad Gita, he gave the last instruction of Krishna in Bhagavad Gita as the first instruction. Recognize that Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him. Then only you will be able to understand Bhagavad Gita not otherwise. Now a qualified teacher or bonafide teacher like Prahupada only teaches like that. Because he has the total understanding that’s why he brings the last thing as the first for our clarity. Right.
    
    Yes you have a question. Yes
    
    Question you have spoken about knowledge and devotion. <inaudible>. In order to advance in knowledge
    
    Gurumaharaj: Very good point. Very good point. You see, material nature and spiritual nature function in different ways. In material nature you first know, you first learn and then you have it. Whereas in the spiritual world, you just become situated there and it automatically comes, right? For example, like in the material nature you have to perceive and then you have to conceive. Right. You see things, you know about it and then you retain it, in your mind in your intelligence in your brain. Whereas in spiritual nature you just practice devotional service and the knowledge automatically comes to your heart. Are you familiar with the expression – Divya Gyan Hrdya Prakasito…Do you come to Gurupuja in the temple, Prabhupada guru puja? Do you sing that song? Sri Guru Carana Padama… Do you know the line
    
    Divya Gyan Hrdya Prakasito : one line from that song is the transcendental knowledge is revealed in the heart. It is not retained here it is revealed in the heart. It also has been analyzed in this way that bhakti devi is the mother. Bhakti is the mother, and she has two sons, those two sons are gyana and vairagya – Knowledge and renunciation. So wherever the mother goes, the son will follow. So wherever there is practice of bhakti there will be knowledge –transcendental knowledge and automatically natural detachment. It will automatically come. Right. Thank you. Hare Krishna
    
    Yes. <another question inaudible>
    
    Gurumaharaj: Very good point. That reminds me, recently, we were in Pennsylvania (at) a retreat, and there, one devotee presented a skit – kind of a drama, dramatically. The drama was about a conversation between twins in the womb of the mother. So the way he portrayed it, one girl was … two actors were sitting on two chairs crouched like they were in the womb and a girl was standing behind them with a piece of cloth which was covering them, and then she removed the thing partly showing that what’s going on. So one of the embryos is sleeping and the other one wakes him up. So he wakes up very agitated – let me sleep, I slept only for 20 hours today and then he goes back to sleep again. Then the other boy wakes him up again and he says look I have something very important to say. He says I heard that there is life after birth (GM laughs). And he says, and in that world there is light. So the other says, how it is possible, how can there be light. How can there be life after birth. This everything, just don’t think beyond this. This is everything and try to enjoy as much as possible (audience laughter). And then he continued, you know there we can eat with our mouth and we can walk with our feet. So he was speaking like that and the other boy, he was completely denied it – how is it possible? Is there anyway we can eat except the umbilical cord. And he said no really it can be …and so then in this way you know like it just goes on. So I thought it was brilliant. Now when we look at our situation form that context , don’t we see that our situation is like that. We are living in a world, …O then it goes into, another very important thing. He says do you know, we have a mother? He says how is it possible, have you ever seen her? (Audience laughter). He says I did not see her but I can feel her. Don’t you realize, don’t you feel that it is because of her that we are existing and then he says, Oh common there is no mother. He says, but we can see, she is all around us. Although we do not see her, but she is all around us and it is because of her that we are getting everything that we need. She is taking care of us in all respects. And … anyway so I thought of sharing. Like you know, I mean, It is so foolish actually, its so stupid to think that this world is everything and our existing here is everything. There is nothing beyond it. But for that to receive those informations we need a bonafide teacher. We need Vaisnav teachings. Spiritual master means (unclear ) who himself has the knowledge and who can impart the knowledge to others. So Prabhupada has created so many bonafide spiritual masters all over the world who are distributing this knowledge and as a result of that the world will benefit.
    
    Ok. Thank you very much. All glories to Srila Prabhupada.
